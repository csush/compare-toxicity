Haiti would be a better place today if the Clintons hadn't pocketed 94% of the Earthquake relief funds.  Millions of dollars.
Do you have any proof?
Yep.  Another absolutely odious thing they did. How are those POSs not behind bars?

What happened to the 10's of millions of dollars given to the Clinton Foundation for Haiti?  Why are they still living in tents all these years later?  I think that's your answer!
the medical ramifications on our already strained healthcare system to treat HIV would be huge.  Those are the most expensive and not so readily available meds.

Anen to that
Casey Walker Yes..look at the shape of the country...that's proof enough they didn't get the help.
And America would be better off if people like you didnâ€™t believe all the lies Fox News tells you.
"Casey Walker Yes theres proof, hell even CNN and MSNBC admitted to it. ALong with ABC, CBS, NBC & FOX. If all of them agree to it. You know it has to be bad"
This is such a good statement.  I am going to make it the heading when I repost.  I hope you don't mind.
Casey Walker yes they didn't get the money what more proof do you need. Brainless
and your proof?
"Now that's the truth, clintons stole millions from the haiti relief fund"
Yes we have proof Casey Walker because Haiti is still a shithole...
Facts_Ÿ˜”
James where are the facts for your statement?   You have been royally conned
You are 100% right
Convenient how you forgot it was the Clinton/BUSH Foundation.  They're all crooks.  Including Trump.
"And who was it from Haiti that came to New York, pissed, looking for a piece of the Clintons?"

Thatâ€™s just a lie.
"Casey Walker Well, you just showed proof that you're naive and stupid!"
Kathryn Roepnack You might learn something true if you listened to FOX...live in ignorance of the truth...go ahead...half the country does. And yes...Haiti is in rough shape...admit it!
EXACTLY! THIEVES !!!
Jennifer Stacey  you know about these millions how?
"Casey Walker, yes I have been there."
Christine Lynn Howell Just look at the condition of Haiti...the Clintons never gave them the money donated for them after the earth quake....10s of MILLIONS...I remember Bill the rapist begging people to send 5 or 10 dollars CASH to help poor Haiti.
"Casey Walker do you have any proof of the contrary? So stupid to support those thiefâ€™s and liars."
Not one shred of evidence has been provided... Just heresay and 'everyone knows'. Prove it. Link to the proof

Right On !
The Clintons also pocketed the funding for a Hospital in Haiti Think how much that would have done for them.
Your opinions do not matter nor did they ever.  #YouAreASlave of the US #Crowncorporation
Robert Webster Jr. No - you are wrong.  Trump is working hard to fix the mess the Clinton's/Bushes/Obama left us in.  Keep up the great work Mr. President.

Exactly

http://stateofthenation2012.com/?p=48339
99% of all charities and foundations keep a percentage. Thats no big news why try and just blame the Clintons ? Just last year the Eric Trump foundation got caught keeping cancer donations for his self. No news nice try though
That's exactly what I read and saw a man from Haiti say...let's face it folks... The Clintons are nothing but crooks! And these LIBS  STILL stick up for them! I don't get it... it's plain to see!!!

Spokespeople for Bill and Hillary Clinton said that they were unaware of the fact, and the permits have been placed on hold by the Senate of Haiti.[33]"

However, while Hillary Clinton did recommend specific companies to help with the rebuilding process and e-mails have surfaced indicating that special attention was given to â€œFoBsâ€ù (â€œFriends of Billâ€ù), thereâ€™s no evidence that the United States government awarded contracts to any of those contenders."

Jacqueline Andrews This thread is about what the Clintons did to Haiti...re-directing to the Red Cross won't change what the Clintons did. Your tactic is typical of all Clinton supporters...deny and re-direct...the Clintons are champs at the same tactic. It doesn't change the facts.
And several villages

USA is the laughing stock of the world because of that OBESE ORANGE BUFFOON and his redneck 'idiot' Trumptard supporters. Looks like USA is the biggest shithole now!
"Which is worse: President Trump calling Haiti a shithole; or the Clintons stealing  $1,000,000,000 from Haiti. Actually, the government of Haiti declares amount of money stolen by the criminal organization know as ""The Clinton Foundation"" as $1,000,000,0000, yes 1 billion dollars."
The haitian people hate the Clintons. And its no wonder why.
"Michael Cohen, the executive vice president of the Trump Organization and special counsel to Donald Trump, apparently started this gossip in a statement to the press. I can find no evidence that he ever backed it up with factual support. To date, there hasn't been proof that the Clinton's stole from Haiti Relief funds from anyone else, either. This is NOT a straight-up defense of the Clintons. There is unimaginable corruption in their personal and public histories. However, may I suggest we stick what we KNOW they have done wrong ~ possibly, probably criminally ~ and not dilute the strength of our accusations with rumor. If you have proof of the Haiti stories, from reliable ~ not uber right sources ~ please provide links with any rebuttal."
Chaz Madrid So regardless of the fact that they pocketed a TON of money. That they SOLICITED for Haiti relief through their crooked foundation. Instead of doing the right thing and giving it ALL to the people they collected it for.... and Iâ€™ll even give you an allowance for a MODEST administrative fee.  Or labor.    But that wasnâ€™t the case.    Yeah.  Youâ€™re a special kid kid stupid.     Learn to focus on the real problems and understand the gist of an issue......retard.

Obama was never transparent...remember if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor...if you like your insurance, you can keep tour insurance... your insurance will go down at least $2500, but instead increased by that amount or doubled...I have to wonder if you think hillary would have been better...??? No, just the opposite...  where are the funds the Clintons collected for Haiti-millions upon millions of dollars missing... missing clinton Foundation money (possibly to pay for Chelseaâ€™s 3 million dollar wedding!)

"Isn't that right James we sent four presidents over there.

Now the great Ben Carson talking. Pathetic
"While the Clintons in their respective roles clearly had a say over where some of the quake relief cash flowed, their political enemies have wrongly claimed the family foundation directly controlled all the billions in funds.The foundation itself raised a relatively modest $30m for aid projects in Haiti.A spokeswoman for the charity told the BBC: ""Every penny of the more than $30m raised was deployed on the ground, with no overhead taken by the Clinton Foundation."""

Yap. Let the Clintons absorb the truth now. They took sucked everything and now expect Donald trump to make it up for the poor.
"Yes, this what I saw in t.v.  Clinton knew which pocket they put it."

"Who cares? Haiti is a $***h0le. The people pretending that Haiti and Norway are equivalent are liars. I guarantee that if they had to choose between sending their children to school that was 100% Haitian vs a school than was 100% Norwegian, they would pick the former every single time."
"Clinton, Clinton Clintons!  The obsession is real!"
God dam right!
I strongly agree with you buddy. This is why the Clinton family dies in the world of politic.
Nikki Gentile didnâ€™t it pay for Chelseaâ€™s wedding?
Ann Parish Harper starting to see bad reports about FactCheck. I wouldn't use them or snoops to verify anything.
The left is still trying to redirect the financial mess in Haiti away from the Clintonâ€™s.
Gabriel Silva paulada
"sad to think they would do that, but they are no good and never will be.........they only know dishonesty, corruption and only care about themselves..........sad there are people like that."
Jennifer Stacey because the Clintonâ€™s are thieves from hell!!
God know one day Haiti going better than America God is good all the time
Jennifer Stacey Sean Penn  did more for Haiti than the Clintonâ€™s.
Casey Walker It is a well known fact that Haiti never got the money and they were planning on suing.  I have not researched it since I read that a while ago.
My god!  Are Trump zombies stupid
Casey Walker Troll
"Aww-James, try to be nicer, even though you are a BOT."
How quick the sheep forget about the crooked Clinton's
James Shipley how do you know that the corrupt Haitian government didn't take the money? That's more likely than the Clintons. Or do you believe Russian misinformation?
"The Haitian government claimed in the 1980s that ousted dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier laundered stolen treasury funds when he bought Trump Tower apartment 54-K for $446,875 in August 1983. Duvalier used a Panama shell company called Lasa Trade and Finance to buy the apartment in cash. Trump signed the deed of sale.â€ù"
"Hey Bill, no one has forgotten the Clintons. How can we? That's all you Trump supporters can talk about to defend Trump. But, but, but...the Clintons. Pretty lame."
do you have proof of that meanwhile the people need help and what is lying Donald doing the liar is saying he didnâ€™t call the country a shithole he must think we are stupid he is right for voting trump in office I hope he is gone away soon

"Peter Flynn You have any probe where the donations where? Because Haitians are mad about it. You do your research.https://youtu.be/3c2oBh1yDhc"
Lyn Gerson Mendelsohn Wrong.  The Clinton Foundation does not ever give money directly to causes like this.  They take bids from people and then give them the money to do the job.  The money for Haiti was given to someone to donate to Haiti and it never got there.
Cathy Meyer As usual.
"Casey Walker  Washington Post, among other sources, the Clinton Foundation raised over $30 million for Haiti relief with many of the Clinton-backed projects not ""coming through"" due to ""poor planning and unsustainable outcomes for taxpayer-funder projects"" promoted by the Clinton Foundation such as a $170 million power plant and port.  The Foundation set out to build luxury hotels and an industrial park  that did not benefit the needy. Bill Clinton was appointed the UN rep for aid to Haiti while Hillary was Secy of State.  Together the Clintons were the two most powerful people controlling  the flow of funds to Haiti. None of this would be problematic in and of itself, if the aid actually did what it was intended.  A pattern developed that a number of companies that received contracts for rebuilding made large donations to the Clinton Foundation. Another example, The Clinton Foundation selected a construction company owned by Warren Buffet's Bershire Hathaway to build temporary shelters in Haiti.  The contract was suppose to be giver through the normal UN bidding process with the contract going to the lowest bidder who met the project's standards.  The UN has stated that the contract was never competitively bid for.  The kicker -- Buffet is a member of the Clinton Global Initiative that has donated generously to the Clintons and their Foundation.     A week before a former Haitian government office was expected to testify against alleged Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice was found dead in Miami from a gunshot wound to the head.  He was expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.  US surgeon, Dr. Lorich, was part of the relief effort sent to assist the relief effort led by the Clinton Foundation in Haiti and exposed the Clinton Foundation corruption.  Dr, Lorich was also was found dead of a stab wound just days before he was scheduled to testify against the Clintons.    His 11-year old daughter found him with a knife stuck in his chest -- NYC police said it appeared to be a suicide.   Hard to prove the wrongdoing when key witnesses keep dying of suspicious suicides."
Only thatâ€™s not true...
Lanre Giwa facts about Clintonâ€™s corrupt handling of Haiti are there and using that disaster as their money earning for their personal  profits .
Exactly
"Jennifer Stacey  there is no evidence that Hillary Clinton, through the Clinton Foundation, raised â€œhundreds of millions of dollarsâ€ù for a hospital that was never built. We consulted groups that have been critical of recovery delays in Haiti, but they could not point to a specific Clinton Foundation-funded hospital project, either.â€œWeâ€™ve tried to figure out what he might be citing as well, but we canâ€™t provide you with a source of his claim because one doesnâ€™t exist,â€ù said Craig Minassian, a Clinton Foundation spokesman. â€œThe Clinton Foundation never committed to build a hospital, nor did it accept, raise, or spend funds for that purpose. His claim is false.â€ù"
The fake news story about Clinton pocketing 94% is attributed to an article in the Providence Jouranal written by a person alleging th Clinton foundation kept too much of the Haiti donations. Do your research. It wasnâ€™t close to 94%. Further the Foundation has a good record. Glad they are being investigated but even if nothing is found Trump will make another allegation and haters will believe it despite the fact the only truth for Trump is his claim he could shoot someone and still not lose his base. If it werenâ€™t so creepy it would be funny
"Jennifer Stacey the money was stolen by Haitian politicians and Venezuelan businessman Claudio Osorio and others.  In addition many pledges from other countries were never sent because Haiti is rampant with political fraud.  I donâ€™t like H. Clinton, but blaming Dems for Haiti is like Trump claiming credit for 9 straight years of airline safety (yes, he did)."
"Keri Heart The Haitian protesters noticed an interesting pattern involving the Clintons and the designation of how aid funds were used. They observed that a number of companies that received contracts in Haiti happened to be entities that made large donations to the Clinton Foundation. The Haitian contracts appeared less tailored to the needs of Haiti than to the needs of the companies that were performing the services. In sum, Haitian deals appeared to be a quid pro quo for filling the coffers of the Clintons. For example, the Clinton Foundation selected Clayton Homes, a construction company owned by Warren Buffettâ€™s Berkshire Hathaway, to build temporary shelters in Haiti. Buffett is an active member of the Clinton Global Initiative who has donated generously to the Clintons as well as the Clinton Foundation. The contract was supposed to be given through the normal United Nations bidding process, with the deal going to the lowest bidder who met the projectâ€™s standards. UN officials said, however, that the contract was never competitively bid for. Clayton offered to build â€œhurricane-proof trailersâ€ù but what they actually delivered turned out to be a disaster. The trailers were structurally unsafe, with high levels of formaldehyde and insulation coming out of the walls. There were problems with mold and fumes. The stifling heat inside made Haitians sick and many of them abandoned the trailers because they were ill-constructed and unusable. The Clintons also funneled $10 million in federal loans to a firm called InnoVida, headed by Clinton donor Claudio Osorio. Osorio had loaded its board with Clinton cronies, including longtime Clinton ally General Wesley Clark; Hillaryâ€™s 2008 finance director Jonathan Mantz; and Democratic fundraiser Chris Korge who has helped raise millions for the Clintons.Read more at: http://www.nationalreview.com/article/437883/hillarys-america-secret-history-democratic-party-dinesh-dsouza-clinton-foundation"

Try BILLIONS!!
True story
"A little education for you so you don't stay stupid. The FactsThe Clintons played a major role in recovery efforts in Haiti after the devastating earthquake in 2010. Former president Bill Clinton was the public face of U.S. efforts in Haiti through several recovery roles. He was the United Nations special envoy to Haiti, co-leader of the Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund (with former president George W. Bush) and co-chairman of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission, a quasi-government planning body that approved hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. government-funded recovery projects.The U.S. Agency for International Development supported the commissionâ€™s efforts, and Hillary Clinton led the U.S. response in Haiti as secretary of state. The Clinton Foundation raised more than $30 million for Haiti relief projects.There are hospital projects that have been delayed, but thereâ€™s no evidence that there were â€œhundreds of millions of dollarsâ€ù in foundation money promised to those efforts.For example, the USAID inspector general found delays in the $99 million reconstruction of medical facilities and medical supply warehouses through the Health Infrastructure Program. This program included the $82.3 million construction of the countryâ€™s key public hospital, the Hospital of the State University of Haiti in Port-au-Prince, one of the first projects that the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission approved. But the project is backed by money from the U.S. government, Haiti and France â€” not the Clinton Foundation.Thereâ€™s a lot of criticism lodged against the Clintons for their involvement with recovery efforts in Haiti. But Cohenâ€™s claim that Hillary Clinton raised hundreds of millions of dollars through the Clinton Foundation for a hospital that was never delivered is not credible."
"Yeah something else Hillary collected for Haiti _Ÿ‡__Ÿ‡_ that was funneled into the Clintons Foundation and never distributed to Haiti or its people another Clintons fraud and pocket lining,they are the scum of the earth _ŸŒè"
Charles Winslette so you pick and choose when the so called fake media lies. Lmao.
"The present reference to Haiti concerns Trump referring to it as a ""shithole""repeatedly. As usual, when there's no legitimate defence for Trump's ignorant and derogatory blabbering, his worshippers deflect to the perceived flaws of another person to try and prop up Trump's incompetency. If Trump weren't such a schmuck, maybe someone intelligent would listen to him."

Lisa Richardson If you read the history of Haiti you would know why Haiti will never be able to rise in the western world. Its not the Haitians why Haiti is in poverty it's because of certain world leaders who can never forget how badly they were beaten. They cannot allow such power and might in their backyard especially by Blacks. Remember  black wall street in this country and how it was burnt to the ground and the people killed . Any uprising of wealth and strength by blacks that poises a threat will in some way be bought down to the ground. I would like you to get a copy of this book .

Oh what a great and truthful comment _Ÿ‘ç_Ÿè»
I would love to see the data on that. You canâ€™t make up facts.
Hillary and Bill were the Bonnie and Clyde of Haiti. Pathetic!
Liar.
Correct.
Any of the work that was done in Haiti was offered to Clinton's cronies and then they turned around and donated to the Clinton Foundation!  One of their friends had a big loan that was given to them and he purchased three houses and then went bankrupt so the money never got paid back that was one of their friends.
They had help from Obamas to tratiors
"94% is very specific and I'm sure you read it somewhere and are too lazy to see if its accurate.  But all the hating of Clintons and Obama aside, please look at your hero in the White House and recognize him as a poor excuse for a human being."
"Kieran Brennen they might not be on the political board but they won't go away, their evil is still flowing thru the system. Justice is not only blind, but deaf and dumb too. if a normal person pulled even an 1/8 of what Hillay, Bill, John Podesta, McCain pulled, they would be in jail for life. so many deaths at her feet, oops I mean ""suicides"" and fires at each of her homes that always only got paperwork and computers, something smells and its not her onion and urine smell that John P.said in his emails..."
Jennifer Stacey what happened to the money in millions Americans paid to the Clintonâ€™s foundation ? It went to fund Chelsea â€˜s wedding and bought Chelsea a 10 million dollar NYC apartment.
John Magill ok so whereâ€™s the proof? If he said he will admit it. Two other senators came out and said they donâ€™t remember him saying anything like that. Another dem trying to obstruct. But you say thereâ€™s proof???  Where???  I havenâ€™t seen any
Kathryn Roepnack grow the hell up and wake up ! Democrats donâ€™t even like you. Good grief. Try C-Span.
David Webb we KNOW this is true.
No it was 6 billion dollars. And Hillarys brother is stealing all the profits from their mines too.
But they divert their attention to Trump and make up lies  along the way.  I think this country is on shaky ground because of this hypocrisy that undermines everything Trump tries to do.
"Casey Walker the hatians say they never received a penny, but the money was removed from the Clinton foundation.  where did all the money go?  who cares, and what does it matter are not acceptable answers here."
Kathryn Roepnack you mean CNN right? Fox is very fair and balanced more so than that other shitshow
I would like to know how in the heck the Clintons got by with this!! To think how many hard working people in this country donated and I wonder if any of the money went to the people that needed it. Why is there no accountability for the people in charge of all the donations.
amen!!
These are the days of Money grabbing. You can't trust anyone in charge because if they don't steal they don't serve the Theives. If they steel it's from the least organized group. It steels from the people they happily keep divided.
"Casey Walker, where is your proof Trump said Shithole? None! because he didn't say it!  Get off the koolaid."
Casey Walker You're dumb.
"Casey Walker yes, the country would not be in the shape its in if the money had been there for them. The Clintons pocketed for sure. However, the government in Haiti is extremely corrupt, they have been helped so many times and it doesnâ€™t happen because they keep getting robbed of it. Which is probably what President Trump meant to say. He is not far from the truth, was not explained correctly_Ÿ_·_Ÿè»â€çâ™€ï¸è"

"Charlie Jackson I did not vote for Trump. I defend his words because #1 he is speaking honestly from an economic view point. It has nothing to do with race. It is fact that we can only take in, by law, a certain number of people.  It's a legitimate economic question to ask why we are taking in 50k Haitians and turning away others that might have more of a positive impact on the economy versus ones that might be more of a burden. There is a fine line between taking people in that need help and causing a detrimental affect on local, state, and the national economy.  It is part of who we are to allow the less fortunate in. But 120 years ago those people faught like hell with little to no assistance because it wasn't about handouts, it was about opportunity and freedom to make it on your own. There is a reason why Syrian refugees went to Germany and it had nothing to do with freedom or opportunity.   #2 This was a private meeting. The only reason there is outrage is because a 35 year dirt bag politician, lying Dick Durbin, said something. He has lied about meetings in the past. Even if it is true he should keep private discussions to himself. He is the one that is using a moment not meant for public consumption as a political weapon. Instead focus on coming to an agreement on DACA and other immigration reform. Trump showed good faith to work with the other side to make something happen, and we see where it went. #3 did you even read the article?  The Clinton administration screwed Haiti. They are still trying to recover and the hurricanes and earthquake hasn't helped. Then their foundation screwed Haiti again. The people there would hang them if they got their hands on them. The Clintons are exponentially terrible beyond what Trump may, or may not, have said. Their actions always contradict their words. The Clintons are the creators of sh**holes in the name of lining their donors pockets."
They also used the chaos of the disaster to kidnap an unknown number of Haitian children.

I've been there, and their roads are Dirt & Potholes, their Security provided by the UN, their Sanitary Sewers are Trenches running along the roads, their Gas Stations are Roadside Tables, with Plastic Gallons full of Gasoline!  I think Trump SHOULDA called it a Shithole!"
Idiot
"The Clintons gave 6% of the donated money to the To the people Of Haiti, the rest was for them."
"Liberals are  more concerned with what Trump may have said about Haiti, then what Hillary actually DID to Haiti. Go look it up people. She extorted that country like no other!"
The Clintons stole a lot of the money that went to Haiti.  Remember THAT!!!
"TALE OF TWO PRESIDENTS:President Trump â€” ""Haiti's a sh*thole, we don't need more immigrants from sh*thole countries."" _Ÿ’©President Clinton â€” ""Haiti? Oh man, that sh*thole â€” let's use sympathy for the people there to make millions - hell, HUNDREDS of millions - through 'global charity,' then launder it through the Clinton Foundation. No one will be the wiser â€” it's for the children, right?"""

Classic deflection from a Trump cultist.
"My dear president I love you, may you have a good day today_Ÿ˜_"
She certainly did!!!
"Giovanny Francesco Tarrago, classic deflection from a HC cultist?"
Right on Paul
Thank you for Validating Trump and Hillary are one on the same.   I agree.
The Libs need to be looking at Hillary!
Giovanny Francesco Tarrago Classic denial of the truth from a Clinton commie.
another defender of a lowlife.
Hillary?? you're nuts
https://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-suppressed-haitis-minimum-wage/
Perfect response Paul Galvez you are absolutely correct. The Clintons RAPED the Haitians after their country and many of them were destroyed.
"Maybe some people are upset about both. It is just people who support this SHITHOLE orange clown try to blame everything on Obama and Clinton because that is all they have. This pile of trash is so called President, she is a washed up two time loser yet you Trumptards bring her up every two seconds."
Truth!
Giovanny Francesco Tarrago No deflection as you call it was necessary It just pointed out the one sided viewpoint of the dems and what a real travisty the clintons did
Thay are narrow minded people.
Giovanny Francesco Tarrago  SO you idiots don't care what the clintions did ? and even if he did not say it i will . the place is a S**T HOLE run by S**T HEADS
Giovanny Francesco Tarrago  is this deflection true or false??? Calling a country a name is NOT the same as stealing from them.
Bill and HILLARY pocked a TON OF CASH from the Haiti relief deal.
"Kevin Marshall.  So saying something, if said, is as bad as pocketing a pile of cash meant for aid? If that's what you think my friend you have a strange set of priorities."
"Not only that, She was implicated in CHILD trafficking down there, And one of her aids was ARRESTED for trying to bring 30 children OUT OF THE COUNTRY ILLEGALY...!!!"
Hillary not sitting in the oval office..Donald need to accountable for his words..He's a total embarrassment to America!
"Giovanny Francesco Tarrago actually, no matter what this president did, it could never equal what Hilary and the democrats have done. Thatâ€™s not deflection. Thatâ€™s truth."
So what you mean is because one screwed up it's carte blanche for anyone else after screw up? Great there is not end to this circus from hell.
Wtf does Clinton have to do with what Trump said?
The real embarassment is admitting you voted for Hil liar y.
more concernedabout his decorum in his ability be presidential and level-headed Maniac has a launch codes. Signed a concerned north of the Border Canadian who sees obvious signs of dementia and Alzheimer's in your leader. I don't like him but I feel bad for him that I see these signs.
You cultists and your whataboutisms and deflections are absolutely hilarious.
"Jack Mullen, I'll bite, what, specifically did the Clintons do do to steal money?  I mean, I know they made recommendations for contractors in the rebuilding effort but I've never seen even remote evidence that they made money or even that the US used these recommended contractors.  I'm open to new information though."
Yes and makes you understand why the Bush family chose to vote for Hillary..they all had dirty hands
Ikr. Gullibles much
Cynthia Harris- did he hurt your super sensitive feelers?
You're the embarrassment to this country
But they build a $7m resort that now employs 11 Haitians at appx $22usd/day
"The doctor that was in the news couple weeks ago that supposedly committed suicide by sticking a knife in his heart, was a part of a group of doctors that went to Haiti to help the poor and sick. This was to be paid for by the funds from that Clinton Foundation. Short time into the mission the needed medications, saline solution all that is required to perform surgery ran out and no matter how much they requested supplies nothing arrived and ppl were dyeing. Eventually the doctors left and on the plane this doctor said he was going to blow the lid off that Clinton Foundation. Well he sure can't say a word now...."
Paul Galvez BOOM drop the mic. Perfect response!
"Cynthia Harris No he is not an embarrassment to the country, maybe you he is, but he is still President of the United States.  I'm starting to believe that he just says it the way it is and doesn't sugar fluff anything."
Randy Stemen do real research.. if your still blind then stay left in the dust....
"Beverly Roberts Other than the fake documentary Clinton Cash and other propaganda sites, do you have any real evidence the Clinton broke any laws or stole any money?"
Exactly!!!
"Cynthia Harris oh stop it. When you grow up you'll see all the elders weren't ignorant misogynistic racists after all. The democrat leaders are lying to you it's been the same mind phuk for a hundred years worth of manipulation and magic tricks.Born Anarchist/sworn Conservative fighting for true equality, democrat leaders wouldn't know true equality if you paid them that's why they steal it all! You wait, you'll see... I waited and guess what those old folks with real wisdom really knew..."
She sure did!And we appreciate you bringing it up and keeping it on the forefront! GOD BLESS!!!
Cynthia Harris you dummycrats are the embarrassment   Haiti  is a sh**t hole
"Kimberly Wiltshire- Hillary used people in need for financial gain in Haiti. If the allegations of what Trump said are true, he made an accurate comment about a corrupt government leaving 40% of the population without running water and most of the population living in abject poverty. You are more offended about a word he used than the underlying situation in these countries. Must be nice being able to cry about a word used while living in a largely racially homogenous country."
Steve Pattison you and the  dummycrats are the embarrassment
The biggest female scumbag in our country.
Cynthia Harris That's just your very narrow opinion
Can I copy this to my page
Cynthia Harris  Hillary not sitting in the oval office for a GOOD reason you dumbocrats are an embarrassment beyond belief and will pay for your stupidity !!!!
"Mark TuchfeldMatter of fact he didn't hurt my feelings should've hurt yours for voting for a shithole President"
Let those who have never used descriptive language in their life cast the first stone!
Cynthia Harris  no he isnâ€™t an embarrassment he is a breath of fresh air! Thank God Hillary Clinton is NOT IN THE OVAL OFFICE.  Now that would be shameful and embarrassing.
If Donald's not an embarrassment WHY does he have a low approval rating Lois Yates ?
Randy Stemen what did they do to steal money? The Clinton foundation bent every possible law towards financial obligation (Hellary is a lawyer) by twisting the percentage due to benefits to charity to the lowest possible number then lying about the amount!!!! They collected nearly a hundred million f'n dollars for Haties behalf thus far there is data saying $1m and $375k have been given to Haiti ... They've learned to do this and donate only s max of 2% at money's over ten million and been doing it since inception they are liars and crooks..
#MAGA
"The questions are, (1) Do you believe he called these countries shitholes, and (2) if so, is it in any way excusable? For me, the answers are (1) Yes, due to multiple on-the-record eyewitness accounts, and (2) No, it is so far beneath the dignity of the office of POTUS that it would have been unimaginable in the pre-Trump era. What anyone else may have done at any other time is not relevant to these questions."
Thanks homeschool
what she did to the children is unspeakable
"Exactly!!! In such a upside down, inside out Orwellian world... All I gotta say is Thank God Almighty for President Trump!!! #MAGA2020"
Jason Cormier mind your own business don't need stupid people Canada making comments!

"Glenn Nelson, 1.  Who cares.  2. Stfu. Who cares? You guy's are so much more worried about words than actions. You guys are all jokes and children.  None of you were upset by any of the Clinton dealings in Haiti.  None of you were upset about Obama's illegal wars and drone programs.  You are playing party politics because you are a child, not because you care about right and wrong."
Cynthia Harris all lies from corrupt news stations!
Fact
Cynthia Harris 46% is great!
Fake news
Bingo ... nailed it.
Stop living in the past. Every time anyone talks about what Donald Trump is doing now the only defense that you can come up with is what Hillary or Obama did then. Hillary is not the president. Obama is not the president. Donald J Trump is the president. It's fine time you started acting like one.
Hillary is not relevant. Move on.
Pam Wiedling cupcake it's 32%
Glenn Nelson #WhoCares  MAGA However absolutely horrendous what the Clintons did to the Haitians. They protested all during the presidential elections but nothing but crickets from The Fake News Networks.
Jason Cormier you  sees obvious signs of dementia and Alzheimer's ? that just PROVES you are an IDIOT with dementia and Alzheimer's
"Glenn Nelson- in other words, you are butt-hurt because a really not nice word was allegedly used in a private, closed-door meeting. Keep crying."
"Sen. Durbin on ""chain migration"": ""I said to the president, 'Do you realize how painful that term is to so many people? African-Americans believe that they migrated to America in chains. When you speak about [it], it hurts them personally. And he said, 'Oh, that's a good line.'"
Your distract and conquer are quite transparent and a bit threadbare.
The Haitian know very well that U S money pledged to them ended up in Clinton Foundation---Check it out/// Liberasl need to remove the blinders & see Hillary & Bill Clinton for what they are !!
Facts are ignored these days - the Clintons really did screw Haiti....equal justice to be found?  Don't hold your breath.
Cynthia Harris. The only ones getting lip blisters are the ones kissing that wicked lying pos hillarys' buns.  Are you that blind?
Marcia Guess Yes and the Haitian people demonstrate in front of Bill Clintons office in Harlem everyday for the money the Clinton's extorted.
MAGA =Morons Are Governing America
Barney Shockley YEP
I guarantee not one of the libs bothered to look it up!
"Cynthia Harris Apparently this meeting he had yesterday he really used some foul language, don't know if this was about Haiti or something else.  His approval ratings (polls) cant believe any of the polls, you don't know who they ask for their opinions.  Our President apparently does not sugar fluff anything.  He is a businessman, and he tells it like it is when it affects America and what they are up against.  Sorry you are offended, this is serious issues he is up against.  You know it and I know it.  So what should he do, people who get offended with everything people say, no matter what it is, sugar fluffing it makes it sound like it is better than it is....He is telling the truth about issues that need to be dealt with in a responsible way.  MAGA."
But always remember we wake up each morning and we have the pleasure to have President Trump in the Oval Office. While Hillary walk through the woods like a crazy old lady. #MAGA
Cynthia Harris- did you think of that all by yourself?
"Barney Shockley unfortunately only people who think and pay attention know that.  Liberals feel, they donâ€™t think, and they get their news from Steven Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel."
Excellent point!
"Of course the media sites, unnamed sources, their go to way of trashing our President."
So what?  Hillary isn't President.  People are concerned about what Trump's words and actions are about Haiti because HE'S THE GODDAMN PRESIDENT!  Hillary can go rot under a rock.  Nobody effing cares.  Trump is in power and he's a menace.
"Just like they carried on for months over something said years ago instead of what was actually DONE right under their noses! The most screwed up and disgusting mess is people!!!   Oh! Remember how they flipped out over him having two scoops of ice cream and First Ladyâ€™s shoes?  Who, in their right mind, would want these idiots anywhere near our leadership positions!!"
Ahh... You must be listening to the same people that said Hillary was going to win...You do know that you really never earned the right to vote don't you?
Giovanny Francesco Tarrago classic denial of the corruption you support and stand for
why can't our president do something about the Clintons they just need to go away for good
Amen!!!
remember how the Red Cross raised millions to help Haiti but only built 5 homes but gave HUGE bonus to CEOs-----never donate to Red Cross
Because your president might be?
Paul Galvez where do we look?  What is your source of information?
Brenda Kettle You must have 'loved' the fist bump
Yup
True statement!
"Because SHE/HE KNEW that it would be the low hanging fruit ! And they would not have the resources to fight for themselves and come after the money legally."
"Cynthia, Oh ... Dumbshit, it is 46% ... Reported by Rasmussen... F your cupcake... liar.I do not even believe in polls online; as you cannot pure sample test a singular online grouping. But, at least stop the lies stupid, you look incredibly beetle-headed."
"""We have in the White House someone who could lead the Ku Klux Klan in the United States of America.""- Rep. Luis Gutierrez"

Didnt realize hillary was president my bad
"Cynthia Harris stole her witty little remark. It's a staple on trump hating websites like Reddit.  Thats the left for you though, bleating out the same regurgitated crap."
"Trump did and said........blah, blah, blah, blah...but Hillary and Bill.....  Trump is president now. Deal with it.  Stay in the here and now. Put your big boy pants on and make your point about the present situation."
Paul Galvez -- You are right on the money regarding the actual damage the Clintons did in Haiti.  Billions swindled or funneled to cronies who did nothing for the Haitian people in a time of extreme need.
They are blind to the truth thatâ€™s why they donâ€™t see it... they donâ€™t want to face their own immorality...
They are shithole countries. The truth hurts or what?
Pity how people seem to take the term 'shithole country' up the wrong way. You can blame the MSM for trying to teach people English I suppose
But what what about what about... You guys are morons
"Thank you for your post. You're exactly right, good retort"
Amen Paul
"How quickly some forget Ol' Bill was in on that, too. He was very involved in the #ClintonFoundationHaitiScam ."
Her foundation stole 30 million dollars donated to Haiti.
Mary..who is the president NOW
That's a good one! Indeed!
She's a crook!
"Glenn Nelson bahaha..do you really believe that President Trump is the first POTUS to ever say something like that? The thing is, years ago the press would never have reported it. Many, many presidents said and did things that the American ppl never knew about until years later. This phony outrage is really getting old."
"So I guess we can continue stomping the Haitians, eh Paul Galvez. You must be one of those deplorables."
And trafficked 1000s of children out of there.

And that one Haitian official the Clintons killed days before he was to testify about the clinton foundation's problems down there!

"Shannon Davis and just what charity are you talking about??  So you are saying itâ€™s ok for Haiti to not get their money?  That is the big story here!  With all the investigations going on to expose ole Hillary, Iâ€™m pretty sure she has more to worry about then just a shut down!"

"A little education for you so you don't stay stupid unless it's to much to read for your brain. The FactsThe Clintons played a major role in recovery efforts in Haiti after the devastating earthquake in 2010. Former president Bill Clinton was the public face of U.S. efforts in Haiti through several recovery roles. He was the United Nations special envoy to Haiti, co-leader of the Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund (with former president George W. Bush) and co-chairman of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission, a quasi-government planning body that approved hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. government-funded recovery projects.The U.S. Agency for International Development supported the commissionâ€™s efforts, and Hillary Clinton led the U.S. response in Haiti as secretary of state. The Clinton Foundation raised more than $30 million for Haiti relief projects.There are hospital projects that have been delayed, but thereâ€™s no evidence that there were â€œhundreds of millions of dollarsâ€ù in foundation money promised to those efforts.For example, the USAID inspector general found delays in the $99 million reconstruction of medical facilities and medical supply warehouses through the Health Infrastructure Program. This program included the $82.3 million construction of the countryâ€™s key public hospital, the Hospital of the State University of Haiti in Port-au-Prince, one of the first projects that the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission approved. But the project is backed by money from the U.S. government, Haiti and France â€” not the Clinton Foundation.Thereâ€™s a lot of criticism lodged against the Clintons for their involvement with recovery efforts in Haiti. But Cohenâ€™s claim that Hillary Clinton raised hundreds of millions of dollars through the Clinton Foundation for a hospital that was never delivered is not credible."
Paul Flansburg he raised a billion for them....where did it go?
Brenda Kettle you are funny girl. You realize bengazi was investigated out the ying yang.  Clinton was not responsible. You sound like an idiot. You are embarassing yourself and have no clue. But Cary on. We think it's hilarious. Oh yeah better prepare you world is crumbling. Muller time!!
100%agree
It's just a fake show.  Like always.
Clinton foundation were probably looking for young children to groom for Bill and his Hollywood mates.
They she all did extorted them of all the money that was donated to help them
"Jason Vernon I heard she went ballistic! Screaming, throwing things, threatening! Quite a mental breakdown!"
"Paul Galvez, they don't want to talk about that though, selective memory. _Ÿ˜è"
Brenda Kettle  have you ever been to these countries?  doubt it
She stole 6 billion dollars from their relief fund and her brother is stealing all their profits from their mines.
DillyDilly ...
"Jamie Scott if she stole 6 billion, then why isn't she a billionaire? #dumbfuck"
And they HATE her!!!!

Sara Butler are you dense??? Those peoples lives are STILL being affected! They did NOT get the money meant to improve those lives that you seem to be PRETENDING to be concerned about!
Carl Payne What are you talking about?
Sara Butler The past is very important.  Forgetting is sure to make the same mistakes over and over.  The Clintons and Obama have commited several offensive things to this country.
I heard a dem. woman say so she's a crook at least she's our crook.
Brian Andrews Marie Perez as well. Dumb dingbat!
dingbat!
Sara Butler the past contains the ugly truth about the democrats.
Carol LeSaicherre  DONALD TRUMP is the best President the country has ever had.
"Is Hillary the president? No!! Who is next, maybe Bush or Reagan!!"
The Haitian official who was to testify against Hillary was found dead with a bullet to his head!
Truth
"Carol LeSaicherre Did you NOT see the news footage?  A super shithole!  Shacks, garbage, a real nightmare!  Sad BUT true! President called it correctly!"
John Hulse you people ALWAYS say â€œ Show me the proofâ€ù Get off your lazy butt and check it out! Good grief! Does someone have to wipe your sorry behind too?

Such an evil wench! God  is watching her.....
This is about trump not Hillary. Stick to the subject. Always gotta distract attention away from the actual subject.
Tracy Glass what a blind sheep
Do you have any proofs ? https://www.snopes.com/clinton-foundation-scores-higher-as-a-charity-than-the-red-cross/
Max Nikolov Putinâ€™s puppet!
Tracy Glass. Stick to the Facts....  Hillary raped haiti.
"What our you guys going to say next? What about Kennedy, what about Bush, What about Carter? I guess nothing about your Trump calling countries shitholes!!"
Because he spoke appropiately. Im sure he knows the difference between a mansion and a shithole.
"I don't think Tracey Hall could have not said any better, Haiti is a shithole, and the Clintons are corrupt. Money can not fix either one, but an orange jump suit can."
Lyn Gerson Mendelsohn..Hillary spent her life making Hillary rich selling out America to our enemies. Bill did the same.  Claimed they were broke when they left White House. In no time they were millionaires.  What business did they open that made them so much wealth so quickly? Let us know so we all call do it.  I've worked all my life and never reached their level of income. I'm ready.  Aren't you?
Truth
Vidal Rowe you realize that PR government is corrupt as hell and their people sit around with their hands out waiting for everybody to fix their Schitt for them.
Chad Cabana ---Plan your next vacation there.
Hillary is not president. This isn't the presidential race anymore.
"Alex F Stay, she did in fact break the law, and you and I would already be in prison. This should concern you, the way the FBI conducts itself should concern you. The way the IRS, and the FBI was instructed to go after political opponents should concern you."
"We had a president who sent pallets full of cash to our enemies, and we are more worried about rather or not Trump talked to some Russians?That's on the same level as Iran-Contra. No one also questions what weapons where being exchanged in Benghazi."
Hillary's behavior not in question in this instance!! SHE IS NOT THE PRESIDENT.  Not a question whether I prefer her or not!......She wouldn't have ever spoke in this manner....she has more common sense and is smarter in government.
"Donna Thompson, are you a taco bowl voter, or a high maintenance voter?"
"Donna Thompson, or maybe Trump should have just called them superpreditors?"
"Hillary was directing those comments toward people, not toward the corruption of a whole country.#haitiisashithole"
Vidal Rowe  so you think we only worry about ONE thing?? The list is long! My worry on Haiti situation is criminal has been allowed to STEAL from charity money!
Tracy Glass  looks more like you wanting  to give a thief a free pass!
Chad Cabana  Their living conditions are shitholes!! No rose colored glasses!  Clintonâ€™s raping the citizens is the outrage here!!
"Certain people....certain responses....you're one of those people,  Jason Vernon."
_Ÿ‘ç
She had help....ask the Bush's!!  They are in bed together!
Donna Thompson so your more concerned with the liar who made up what he said then the action by the Clinton on Haiti and Trumps action to improve America.  What does that say about you Donna?
So true
Paul Galvez    https://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-suppressed-haitis-minimum-wage/
I like facts not accusations.
"Donna Thompson, yes certain people like me actually have common sense, and know that Haiti's government is corrupt."
"Let me tell you something, Stephen Lozano and Jason Vernon....I know you both are smarter than Einstein,. BUT, YES. He DID shame the Presidential office by calling black nations (our Allies) S...holes and whether Haiti government is corrupt or isn't does not excuse the shame that #45 puts on our great America!  It's shameful...and I don't happen to care what you think of my opinion....I WAVE THE RED, WHITE AND BLUE and I get upset when a wannabe shames it!!"
Donna Thompson I prefer to focus on actions not words
Isn't it funny how those snippets come just like ordered. When heat comes on the Democrats somehow something gets leaked and bang were talking about Trump and that he called a sh... Hole a sh... Hole
"Jason Vernon, that's why those countries look that way. Their leaders pocket the money for themselves."
https://www.facebook.com/WorldCloudLA/videos/510666649057522/
"Donna Thompson, let me tell you something. You are an idiot, Haiti is a shithole, and needs to be dealt with like shithole it is. No more sending money to corrupt governments so they can enslave thier people."
"Randall Lamp, exactly. Status Quo, democrat or republican, when someone like Trump wants to upset the apple cart, and actually fix the problem, we have ignorant folks like Donna Thompson defending the corruption."
Neither are right
Paul Galvez. So very true
"Donna Thompson you are another person that is only concerned with your ears... Hillary stole over 8 billion... that is 8 billion dollars from Haiti, but she spoke politely... you are more concerned with words than actions... you will support stealing from a devastated  country as long as speech ids polite... really?.... put your fingers in your ears... look for the results that Trump is giving to America... I will forgive his crude language if he gets results/.... Trump's tweet about a bigger button just calmed Kim right on down ... results is what counts"
"Pissed about that, too, actually."
"Donna Thompson, thatâ€™s the reason he called them for what they are. Their leaders are responsible for the conditions those countries are in. Financially or physically, they are what they are."
"Keeping Haiitiâ€™s relief money like the Clintonâ€™s did, is a perfect example of the problem."
"Donna Thompson, President Trump wasnâ€™t shaming the people of those countries. He was shaming their leadership, and the conditions they created for their citizens. Their leadership deserves to be shamed whether we like it, or not. Liberals need to calm down, and stop being so self-righteous."
Exactly!!!!

"Presidents Bill Clinton and George H. Bush, Sr. raised over a billion for Haiti and Bill Clinton put all of the money in the Clinton Foundation.  In my opinion, that's illegal."
"I looked it up, under R for red herring."
"Very true statement that's another reason why I couldn't bring myself to vote for her. https://youtu.be/4PeO0SfCw5s"
"I don't understand why people keep saying, ""But Hillary!"" What someone else did in the past, be it the Clintons or the Bushes or Nixon or whoever, doesn't excuse our current politicians from bad, immoral, or illegal behavior. What Trump said -- which he doesn't deny -- that certain countries are ""shithole countries,"" damages the U.S.A. Because it not only offends those impoverished countries that we want to be able to work with to help them solve certain issues so fewer of their citizens are trying to illegally enter our country, it also has offended our first world allies which makes it harder for us to have a seat at the table and a voice in discussions about global issues (which affect our economy, our safety/national security, our foreign interests, etc.). You can be a Trump supporter and still point out things he's done wrong. You don't have to blindly accept or defend every word that comes out of his mouth. You can say, ""I like him and think he's doing a good job, but this statement was inappropriate/unpresidential/dangerous/etc. And in fact when you defend bad behavior, from any politician, when you defend Trump calling these places shithole countries, you are emboldening him/them to deny wrongdoing and continue the behavior, which will further hurt the U.S.A. Because you are Trump's supporters, it is even more important that you call him out when he's damaging the country, because he does care about what you think, and you do have an obligation as citizens of this country to guide your elected representatives, including the president, to do the best for this country that they can."
"I looked it up, NO PROOF.  Wishing doesn't make it so.  But then again, you lot here are the gullible religious sorts."
"Edgar Wilde - your momma know you hiding your little girlfriend in her basement? She doesn't question why she has to buy so many diapers every week? Get your nasty little butts out of there, go to school or get a job at Burger King. That's all you are qualified to do. GROW UP!"
Donna Thompson just wow _Ÿ˜® you value greed and profit over real world improvements _Ÿ‘ç_Ÿè»
Republicans are traitors to the American people in every way!
Well Edgar Wilde go move to Haiti then.
"Looked it up Paul and found it was the Clinton Bush initiative, not the Trump foundation, I wonder why? Now it's Clintons' fault and Trump gets a pass for not even trying."
"So Donna Thompson you respect Durbins words as fact while 3 others do not recall such words.  So were you one of those people in middle of rumors and hear say controversy as kid?  In addition I believe the small group was put together to negotiate on immigration issues.  After the very first meeting which I am sure in negotiations they were hoping to trust each in order to negotiate a fair deal on immigration.  Yet durbin came out of the meeting like a rat snitching on a conversation to put a spin to make our President look bad!  So these are the people you want to support and negotiate your agenda.  I can assure he is lucky he is a politician because in the business world his days would be numbered.  Didn't Durbin get caught in a lie about another politician he tried to smear for his creditability?  To think we would want a president say things that offend people is BS.  Maybe some of us sick of snitches, obstructionist and childish rumor rats more.  You ever think we would rather these politicians act like adults to in favor of mature professionals that stay more focused on negotiating fair policies for the working class Americans and our vets.  If you prefer rats ok, but don't expect the rest of us to crawl in that hole!"
"I'd rather believe Dick Durbin ( and the Republicans who admitted to hearing the remarks you mention) , than to a man trying to cover his butt...a man who has lied outright on TV for EVERYONE to witness.  Give me a break, Stephen Lozano!!"
"The President calls it like he sees it. That's why the American people support him. General Patton never ""bit his tongue"", why should a strong President do so?"
Yet another fake page! The trolls are out in full force
Brandy John wtf are you talking about?
They are not trolls as they are on the Presidents page supporting the President! LOL
Brandy a Fake page with 310 supports ?  try again.
"""supports""?"
"Supporters of the president, on his page, supporting him. Yep, smells like trolls to me! _Ÿ™„_Ÿ_·_Ÿè_â€çâ™€ï¸è_Ÿ___Ÿè_â€çâ™€ï¸è"
"I voted for Trump and make no apologies for it. I will say there is a bit of a difference between a combat general making remaks and the leader of the Free World...He needs to understand quickly that everything he says to anyone, anywhere will be leaked and over blown to epic proportions...and needs to filter some of his words a little better. (and no in not saying be PC either) as in today's society the over emphasis on words and not actions is at an all time high....I mean come on, people want Oprah to run for President over a simple speech at a meaningless awards show...lol"
Because today's adults are a bunch of overgrown babies.
Brandy John OBVIOUSLY You are the TROLL donâ€™t you THINK_Ÿ_”
respect of our neighbors duh
"The American people donâ€™t support him , only people like you."
"Maybe he could of used better words but heâ€™s right. These countries are _Ÿ’©. Worse, Clinton and Obama ripping of relief money."
"C'mon you get caught calling a country a shithole, everyone defends what you said, them he said he never said it. making everyone who defended him look stupid cause ""he never said it"" and now in his defence you just use Hillary? Please someone take his Twitter account and have him focus on work and not toilet tweets."
If you need an answer to your question means you are just as dumb as he is
Brandy John do you actually expect to be taken seriously while supporting thousands of unattractive females who dress up in pussy costumes and hats who also expect to be taken seriously?
Joel LaMonica meaningless award show?? bet u watched it though huh
Because his words have global consequences! He should stop pandering to his mouth breather base and realize he is (regrettably) the leader of the U.S.
thats the truth
Brandy John <<<<<<A troll calling Trump supporters trolls.  Hilariously stupid!!
"Linda L Hopkins Do you mean consequences from 'when terrorist groups like BLM chant ""death to police"" and ""Pigs in a blanket, fry em like bacon?""  Hey, thanks for supporting a national terrorist group!  You're a great American!!"
I wonder how the Liberals feel about Hillary paying for a totally fake dossier and causing a fake investigation of our President on Russian collusion . Hillary was the one colluding with the Russians to write a FAKE dossier. This investigation has cost this country millions...because of Hillary...and her total jealousy of now winning the election. What a cry baby she is. And she asked Trump is he would accept the results of the election...and then she WON'T. LOL...
_Ÿ_–
Brandy John yep. Not one friend _Ÿ˜œ
I hate this mentality- it's bullying. It's not okay.
"Haiti IS a $hithole. Why do so many want to move here, & why do the ones here not want to move back? Because it's a wonderful place?"
You may support him. But the majority of Americans DO NOT.
Too bad  the liberals weren't more sympathetic about killing babies by abortion...an act of murder..It's what you do that is a crime....not what you say.
"Why not? Because your'e the President of the United States, and your words have an affect on how the world views us all."
"Brandy John You are an Idiot, go preach to the Black Community who needs a lot of HELP_Ÿ‘ç_Ÿ_”"
Speak for your self. American's do not all support him just the ones he doesn't talk about
Edward Comiskey âù„ï¸è
Melissa Marcus Pearlstone Speak for Yourself Moron_Ÿ‘ç
Linda L Hopkins calling all Trump supporters â€œMouth Breathersâ€ù haha this Mouth Breather is a Non Commissioned Officer in The United States Army. The â€œresistance â€ù group is a bunch of Whiney Spineless punk criminals.
"Karl Lietzenmayer You sound like the Terrorist, someone should keep an eye on you, ha freek"
"Most of us hardworking Americans agree to not accept immigrants and give them a govt handout. If they want to come to America, they need to financially support themselves. It's not right for them to automatically get govt $ without ever having contributed."
Melissa Marcus Pearlstone ...... you couldn't be more wrong! TRUMP 2020!!!
"Carlos Mendoza; Suggestion : Book your next family vacation to one of these countries or if you want to visit a city in the US go to the homeless encampments in San Francisco or LA, Chicago,  Detroit or Baltimore,  lots to choose from."
Amen Don..
"Im related to Gen. Patton, he's my cousin somewhere..a distant one. No wonder, when I speak ..I speak with a double edged sword out of my mouth. I've learned some self control though."
Patton is one of my favorite Heros
And he was fired!!!!
"Edward Comiskey; The world doesn't pay my bills so their opinions don't count. Those countries scream to the top of their lungs when Trump says he will stop giving them Americans tax dollars. Charity begins at home, we have homeless, especially our homeless Vets to help, I'm not PC,  just tell it like it is, got a problem with that  then you can pay my bills,for me, deal?"
TRUE
Youll support eachother even in hell neh
Comparing a draft dodger to a combat veteran is getting is really a stretch you cult people are morons
"Cause one is president, one was a general. Pretty obvious answer there."
Susan Heller not Oprah
"Nancy Benton Has nothing to do whatsoever with the comments made last night.  There is a way for someone to be able to support someone or something, yet stand up and critique at the same time.  That's what you should be doing instead of defending, defending, defending, and deflecting!"
Nancy Benton  not a but but Hillary moment _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚
"This is what the president is:S**thole"
I wonder how many rounds of golf old orange Captain Shithole Bone Spur is gonna play on taxpayers dime this weekend?  See ya at midterms _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ‡·_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡·_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡·_Ÿ‡º

Great analogy Don!
And the big orange baby is too scared to go to the UK for fear of being booed right out of the country _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚
Nancy Benton You most certainly are a SPECIAL KIND of STUPID!!!
General Patton did speak freely but he thought before  he spoke and dealt  in facts
"Melissa Marcus Pearlstone;Since when do you speak for,the majority of Americans? You don't speak for me. I left the,Democratic party after Obama said,Democratic voters,are,ignorant and,Hillary stuck a fork in it by saying Democratic voters are,F____g dumb and stupid, I'm done! Bless your heart"
"Natasha Bitter are you really so ignorant that you do not understand he owns the golf courses?  He has not spent a dime on golf, he does not take a wage and he works more hours in a day that any prior president!  You people are so blinded by your socialist hate that you cannot see anything past what the media tells you to see.  That is brainwashing and you don't see it that is a shame!  #stopsocialism"
Agree!
"Evander Jenkins; Those countries are,SH's, don't believe it book your next family vacation to one of the countries, put your money where your mouth is."
"Patton was drummed out of the military, genius."
"Natasha Bitter; Honey,  Miller Lynn is correct,  couldn't have,said it better. Maybe you need to book your next vacation to one of the SH countries,  nothing like seeing first hand, BYW, I have,seen it first hand"
"Melissa Marcus Pearlstone well lucky for us this country is not a democracy, it is a Constitutional Republic!  That is why we have the electoral college, that way the state of california and New York does not control the whole Country. We all know that you socialists are trying to destroy our Country and you believe everything your media tells you too, it is a shame.  People like you make me sick, I never thought I would see a day when people are unable to think for themselves.  But looks like Saul Alinsky's plan to destroy America is rooted in the former democratic party."

John Ho patton died in a jeep accident!
"Well, apparently not since he is saying he didnâ€™t say what he is accused of"
Heh Al Manfroni Patton was the go to general he died in a car crash in Germany running the Army
His words aren't strength in fact they are callous and he is weak for using them.
Sharon Manasco-Smades I do 100%
"Al Manfroni; After 36 years in the Army and vehicle accident that he died from 12 days later was suspect.  No he,wasn't PC but got the job done. FDR the,Democratic President and his fellow democrats did nothing during the time 6 plus,million jews,were murdered; didn't want to get involved, sent Patton in and WW2 ended. As a thought, I wonder how many babies have been aborted in the US since abortions became legal? Got to love Hillary, said late term abortions and abortions up to the time the baby  is born is what she stands behind."
Vivi Enid absolutely correct!
"Trump doesn't 'call it like it is', he's a compulsive liar. He won't come to the opening of the new $1billion Embassy and doesn't even know it was initially started during Bush's presidency, but still has to lie as to why. Oh, and this isn't 'liberal' press. https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/903742/donald-trump-london-uk-trip-visit-cancelled-reason-new-us-embassy-jeremy-corbyn-sadiq-kahn"
"Vivi Enid; Honey he's not PC and not a spineless wimp. Poor girl, Obama said you are,ignorant and Hillary said you are,F____g dumb and stupid : Their description of Democratic voters. BYW: Do you stop at red lights and stop signs, if so, why?"
I'm sorry when was Patton president again?
RIGHT
Carol Gage book your next vacation on the mayflower.
Fine. Make him a general but get him out of the Oval Office.
"The ONLY person in that meeting denying that Trump made derogatory remarks is Donald Trump, the most prolific liar in the history of the presidency."
He's not a strong president. He's very weak and that's proved. CNN is a respected global network that reports excruciating truth like it is. He needs to work on his intelligence. His ADD and ADHD is absurd.
"I agree, but the dems are out to crucify him. They will do and say anything to make him look bad."
General Patton wasnâ€™t a flaming idiot Don!
"Elizabeth Ivana Szymanska Really, the weak one was the one that bowed down to everyone. NO, Trump is strong, get a grip on reality snowflake."
Linda Miller Trump is making himself look bad.  He doesn't need any help to do that.
"Al Manfroni; Yep, after 36 years in the Army, why did it take so long if Patton was such a slug?"
Craig Dunlap I think he was talking about a great leader moron
"William Bush; Guess you haven't got past being PC.  We know what 8 years of PC got us and thank God Hillary lost or,we would be in even worse shape. The only opinion that matters to me is the one that pays my bills;  last time I checked I pay my bills. Any liberals or PC folks want to pay my bills?"
"Yeh right, 33% at the most."
And his career went downhill

Edward Comiskey how exactly is Karl a terrorist?
I think Patton had a brain and experience.
"Yes, about 35% of Americans support him. The other 65% see exactly what he is."
"John Ho wow, do you always spout facts that are so sadly false?  Patton died while serving in Germany right after WWII.   He was relieved from a post shortly before he died, but he most certainly was NOT â€œdrummed outâ€ù of the military."
Your a funny lady.
Trumps a fat pussy just like you moron
Carol Gage You call it PC.  I call it Common Decency.
"Hal...typical Liberal...if you don't agree with someone...oh, just punch them out...that solves the problem of your wrong thinking ways. Pathetic."
Reginald Oandasan No...but he sure has the world noticing how Haiti is in such a horrible condition considering the Clintons did collect 10s of millions and KEPT the money for themselves.
And Haiti is a disaster...it's about time people admit that.
Steve Atkinson You're.
Nancy Benton That would be a lie.  The Clintons didn't get a dime from their foundation.  Please review the 9th Commandment.
Nancy Benton Also a lie.
Dave Condit Yes Dave....they know....the polls are all wrong...and he tells the truth. Haiti is in horrible shape....too bad all the 10's of millions collected by the Crooked Clinton Foundation was never received to actually help Haiti. When are you liberals going to admit....the Clintons are crooks!
Ann Travinsky May I ask....why do you bother reading the Trump site?
I wouldn't never waste a minute of my time on a Clinton site...NEVER>
..
Do me a quick favor and speak for yourself
If he â€˜calls like he sees itâ€™ why is he now denying it? Cowardice.
"Michael, Don was speaking for himself... Einstein..."
Commandment? Lmfao Billy Bob...
"Hey Nancy, but, but, but...THE CLINTONS! Always the classic Trump supporter non-defense of Trump."
#shitholepresident
"Dave, That is not how polls work you dimwit."
"JoAnn DeAngelo; Well if you think Trump is brainless and the fact that he made his millions from private sector I would rather be brainless than supporting Democratic politicians that have sucked off tax payers as career politicians, they wouldn't last one day in private sector."
Diane #shitholeuneducatedvoter
Linda Miller Trump does that himself by opening his mouth....
Linda Miller He doesn't need the Dems help to look bad.  He takes care of that himself.
Darren Lake heâ€™s denying how it was said thatâ€™s the difference!!
"William Bush; You want to pay my bills for me? MSM, Rinos and Democrats have been trying to make Trump look bad from day one. I'm not PC."
He calls a spade a spade....
"Gerry Judice Trump is a liar, and you full well know it."
He's real!
Same with Truman take no prisoners
Dave Condit be careful with those numbers. They have been known to be wrong in a big way!!
Denise Foot  be afraid.  More to come.   He calls a spade a spade.  Tired of putting money into that pit.   It's leaders are theives and the poor people suffer.     more people should stand with Trump on this and call it what it is.   He feels sorry for the people.
And Patten was reprimandedo
Learn how to spell Pattons name^
Disgusting bigot
Renee Kinninger It was the yahoo Dick Durbin from Illinois that claims he heard him say this In other words another lie from the left..
"Renee, Card denied due to erroneous usage..."
"Don, comparing Trump to Patton is like comparing Courtney Love to Mother Teresa!"
"Trump trains draining the swamp,  truth hurts!"
A friendly reminder- he is not supported by a majority of Americans. He won not by popular vote.
he is not strong
The American people donâ€™t support him. The 35% low information base is all he has.
"Yeah, but two big differences between this clown and Truman and Patton.  They werenâ€™t pathological liars.  They were willing to subject their speech to scrutiny.  How anyone can support this level of lying, Iâ€™ll never understand.  45 has the worst character of any leader we have ever seen."
Nancy Benton where on earth do you get your information from?
"Don Shaffer You are so lucky to have him as your President and you don't even know it. Ignorance is bliss. BTW....have you ever been to El Salvador or Haiti ? I have. They are exactly what he described them as. Sh#t holes. Gang infested sh#t holes, and people like you want them to come here and louse up this country."
"I agree.  Now could you find us a strong, honest president?"
Remember when General Patton got a bunch of soldiers needlessly killed in order to rescue his son-in-law from a POW camp and lied about it? That's Trump in a nutshell.
"Judy, That is a false equivalency... You fing genius!_Ÿ˜‚"
"Don, I will put my IQ and multiple higher degrees against you in a debate; anywhere, anytime kiddo! Bring it, it is a beautiful day to melt snowflakes delusions..."
"Diane, A friendly reminder; Trump voters know the Presidency is decided by the EC. Whereas, Hitlery voters thought they were in HS still. The Presidential Election will never be decided by popularity!_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚"
God forbid we elect a man that doesn't pretend to be perfect and speaks his mind... for anybody that doesn't think those countries are shitholes they just don't travel that's all... they have never left the United States and they live in a box
"Diane Duplessis Morrill just keep scrolling and trolling....somewhere else,,,,"
Cristal Rauert Nothing I've seen in your comments lead me to believe that you are adept at debating. You need heat to melt a snowflake. I'm dubious that you could light a match.
Do the American people support him??? Isnâ€™t his approval rate down to 32%? Certainly is!
"Russell Stark Most African countries are no more shitholes than much of the United States. In California alone, you have the Inland Empire, which is arguably worse than South Africa."
"Youâ€™re as disgusting as your leader. Yep, calling it as I see it."
"âœ”  Don J ,Well - written ._Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸  â˜º  _Ÿç·"
"Except that the American people don't support him...that insinuates that the majority of people do, and we know that isn't the case."
"This is what the president is:Sh*thole"
"""I am the light, what you seek is flame""Lmfao Ryan! What have you added to any of the debates? Nothing, you kind of suck; your momma is just too proud to tell your emotional self. _Ÿ˜è_Ÿ˜‰"
"Ryan, I have many friends in Africa; it is in a communist state. The government confiscates the farmers cattle. Kill their cattle, and kill their own people for speaking out against true tyranny. They take their land from them for doing nothing. Educate yourself before erroneously attempting to emasculate others."
Well i call it like it was@first this is the american indian land they discovered american not the so call white pale man!! America belongs to the great american lndian!!!
"Joe, WTF makes YOU anymore American than any other citizen? By the Constitution you are a delusional liar guy!"
"You right, The President call it like he sees it ever if is lie."
"Unser Salinas Muriel So, you are party blinded; good to know._Ÿ_”"
"Haydee, What?""Your right, the President call it like he sees it ever if it is lie.""FFS grammar classes woman!"
"Don Ray,we used to admire your country as a beacon of the free world,you and your president have made us hate every inch of you"
Tara Chikukwa Your hatred is your issue; you allow others to control your emotions.
Cristal Rauert You allow Trump to emotionally manipulate you; you have no reason to throw stones in that respect.
"Cristal Rauert: ""Africa"" is not a country, and the number of communist states in Africa is in the single digits, if that. Your knowledge of geography is dubious, to say the least."
"Don Jay - Two things - 1) his sight is skewed.   or, 2) He needs glasses."
Dems don't like the truth!!! Lmao
Tara Chikukwa then stay out!
Susan Stein Dump has never told the truth. Who gonna pay for that wall?! You are! _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜…_Ÿ˜…_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜…
Cristal Rauert can you see me now?
"Ryan Jackson No I do not Ryan. So in your genius, I am not allowed to respond to stupidity? Way to be a Constitutionalist Einstein..."
Ryan Jackson only the left manipulates with emotions the right talks reality and facts
Frank Garcia Yes we all can!_Ÿ‘ç
Cristal Rauert: The way to respond to stupidity is with intelligence. Someone who mistakes a continent for a country is not someone who has a lot of intelligence to spare.
Phyllis Dailey you can't handle the truth!
"Don, Mexico by way of tariffs and new trade contracts. That has been the plan for years; posted on Trump's page. _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ You trolls suck at conducting viable research."
Frank Garcia you took the words right off my finger tips!
"Cristal Rauert: You think ""Africa"" is a communist country; let's not start impugning the research abilities of other posters."
Don Shaffer you too!!_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚
Haydee Sotomayor Please tell us what was the lie ?
"Frank Garcia Yep, the made-up reality."
Diane Duplessis Morrill wrong
TOTALLY AGREE - SPOT ON
"Ryan Jackson And I did respond that way. Listen guy you are hell bent on trying to discount anything I say. Try coming to a battle of wits armed next time._Ÿ˜‰_Ÿ˜‚"
Frank Garcia a dumpster has never met a fact or reality. Just look at idiot orange. 2000 lies since Election Day.
"Cristal Rauert: A ""battle"" implies some measure of equilibrium between opponents. From our brief interaction, I'm confident that I *tower* over you intellectually. I could no more do battle with you than I could with a pillbug. No matter the variables involved in the *setup* of the battle, said battle inevitably ends with me squashing you as you roll into a ball of ignorance."
"Tara Chikukwa, if you are from another country and you do not like the way it is run, you can leave."
Cristal Rauert you canâ€™t fix stupid. The perpetual problem of Dump and cult45
"Ryan Jackson Really? 151Master(S)SCL3.89What were you claiming Einstein?"
Don Shaffer I know you cannot fix stupid; as you are here daily spreading fodder. _Ÿ‘ç
Cristal Rauert ooh and does that make you sad that most of America isnâ€™t dumb enough to fall for dumpâ€™s lies?
"Typical nonsensical troll clicking on every post a supporter posts. Soros pay double for that stalking move, Einstein?"
"Cristal Rauert: Without the accompanying wisdom, a degree is just a piece of paper. From what you've shown me, you might as well have gotten your degrees from the back of a magazine."
"His point blank, he calls a spade , a spade not a big spoon, he is a great president."
Patton was killed in a car crash can we be as lucky
"Cristal Rauert i couldnâ€™t care less about dems or repubs. But that doesnâ€™t take away the fact that the post was disgusting, as your leader."
"Comparing tRump to Patton is like comparing Cheerios toa good steak.General Patton was fightinga war, he studied his enemy,he knew how hard his job was and knew how to do it.tRump does not know how to do his job, he does not study the issues and so far appearsto be still not learning how to do it.Patton got in trouble because he didnâ€™t like playing the PR/warrior game.tRump keeps proving over and over again his great lack of knowledge and refusal to gain any which leads to experience.Heâ€™s made America not great."
"It's quite soothing that racists display that level of ignorance that matches their hatred.Cristal Rauet is one  such bigot who in this day and age still thinks Africa is a single country woow.Secondly Christal thinks Africa is communist,what a shame"
"Jo Knerr,i have no desire to be in America a place where racists thrive,would rather be in my country, we are doing just fine contrary to what your sh*thole president tells you."
"BLESS YOU MATE. IT MAKE ME VERY SAD.WHAT HAPPENED IN HOLLYWOOD. THEY LOSING CONFIDENCE AND DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. ONLY SHOWING NO RESPECT FOR THE AMERICA PEOPLE. WITH A BIG THIRTY AND FILTH WORD'S  ON TV.GOD HELP THE U S A ."
KaaaaaaaaaaaaBOOOM_Ÿ‘è_Ÿè__Ÿ‘è_Ÿè__Ÿ‘è_Ÿè_
"Bill Muller read ""target patton"" the book..he was assassinated"
It also cost Patton his command.
"The American people donâ€™t support him. Look at the approval ratings. He lost the popular vote by a landslide. If you wish to say that you and the extreme right support him, I can accept that. However, to suggest he is anything other than the least popular president in history is simply false. Just because the president spins false facts daily that doesnâ€™t make his propaganda remotely true."
Ryan Jackson masters in print journalism _Ÿ˜‚
i call it like I see it also. he should be in an asylum _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ_«
Yes our president has courage
"Alexandr S a Russian author said when country lacks courage, it's the beginning of the end of it."
"Because manhood is one of the first things to come under attack by the elitist politically correct crowd. If men can be reduced to sniveling, whiny wimps who have to ask permision before they speak their minds it is much easier to control them. If they can be told that speaking the truth will offend someone, and that bothers them, then they are not men in my estimation."
Does anyone think George Washington would be biting his tongue?
I totally agree we voted for him because he wasnâ€™t a player in politics like many of the past Presidents
Tara Chikukwa fantastic idea _Ÿ’¡
Don Jay Eisenhauer pretty much punished Patton for his grand standing....who was the better general and elected as a Republican president ?
"Yeah I guess everybody should be just like ole Barry, just tuck your tail between your legs and bow your head.  Good for you President for speaking your mind, fearless, patriotic Americans support you!!!"
"Don Jay, how can you say the President of the United States should speak like a gutteral low life.  It's demeaning to our country and our people.  He just isn't worthy of his position."
General if he were still living would delight in blowing Trumps Cheeto topped head of for kissing up to Putin and Russia he's the worst President in history
Don Jay Actually Patton did bite his tongue and had to apologize for it.... Then it ended his military career
You're a joke_Ÿ˜‚
Great comment
"You need to look up the word Strong.Drump is the total antithesis.He is a weak, spinless bully."
"YES!!!! _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸ Well said, Don Jay!"
Patton got fired.
I agree!!!!
That's why we love him
Agree_Ÿ‡¨_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¨_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‘ç_Ÿ‘ç
Amen.
lol suck it up LIBTARDS [[STICKER]]
Exactly...more democratic sheep that canâ€™t think for themselves!
"Yes , but it will not be as he sees it today , when we'll have real good leaders overthere , who will also have courage to stop letting the the american goverment control our politic system."
Good point Don
Comparing Trump to General Patton!? That's a far stretch don't you think. Didn't Trump dodge the draft (five deferments).
He should not have said it and that he hunt him for doing it!
Don't compare trump to Patton. ...
Don Shaffer Can you tell me just one lie ?
Seek help.
Strong President?  Lol.... trump is a little minded fragile snowflake.  He is the weakest shithole President we have ever had.
"We can tell you many lie's just now what he said check your facts He lied way back about his University which was not a university, that Bosco was one way back, Mexico will pay for the wall and many more"
"you really. really need to reed more, and get the fact's straight"
He is not strong he is a salesman that takes advantage of the weak that is not strong
"Patton took a lot of heat because he possessed no verbal filter, not a bad thing."
Unser Salinas Muriel you must be talking about Dick Durbin and the leaders of the far left in America President Trump is doing Awesome how Great President Trump is for the USA...the worlds economy will fall in line with his accomplishments in America...
"Richard Faubert hmmm, sounds like you are the weak."
"Richard Faubert sounds like you are the one that needs to ""read"" more"
I speak the truth too. So big rump Trump should go back to Switzerland where he came from.
Eileen Kessler Hinds when was Patton fired.
Trump is so dumb!
"When you accept any job there is a certain decorum, protocol. He has acted impulsively, inappropriately, and downright unpresidential! Not the way I expect the Commander in Chief to behave and represent me. Maybe others can accept him, but I cannot."
Don Jay...half the Americans  support him.
He would have loved President Trump and been a huge fan!
"We expected that from Obama and Clinton and you see the stains they ""left"", but no big deal, yet you blow out of proportion everything President Trump, who has done so much good in just one year. Get on board or you'll be ""left behind"". The Trump train is full steam ahead for the USA."
"African Americans were once slaves and That 'was' Ok Too, huh?"
What a joke. No further comment needed
35 % or less approval rating is not the Approval and support of the majority of America
"The American people don't support him, where do you live?"
Don Jay  Your response is so wrong it's not worth a detailed response.
"Donna Call. Yes and the fake poll that HC was going to win was hilarious. So fake poll on the Presidents rating."
Marina Leonardos the hell they dont boy
Gayle DeSimone Wyckoff hide for 7 Years.  Helps all of us.
Donna Call says a CNN poll. Lmao. Kinda like he had a 1% chance the day before the election. Enjoy another 7 yrs Donna. I will. _Ÿ™‚
Thatâ€™s why he lost his command.  There are consequences for stupidity.  The general learned that.  Mr Trump will receive his lesson come the midterms elections
General Patton was stripped of a star for subordination
There is a difference between strength and pure arrogance and ignorance. Stop saying stupid things don jay.
"Or Teddy Roosevelt, ""Walk softly and carry a big stick""."
Gayle DeSimone Wyckoff howâ€™d that Presidential decorum of Obama work out for the country???  You demented Dems are more concerned with the messenger than the message.  Guess itâ€™s okay to get screwed as long as you get a little sweet talk to make you feel good.
Roseanne Napier-Riddick have you been stupid all of your life or is it late onset liberal lunacy?

"Steve, I agree. Maybe they should start recording everything that is said. One thing though I am worried about is that President Trump is going to say something like we have heard him say and/or what he is accused of saying and he is going to completely ruin his presidency. Just when he does something really good and people start having a better, more positive feeling about him, he says or does something so inappropriate that he loses support and belief in him. I am concerned about this!"

They would leave parts out! Add parts or take completely out of contents! Absolutely disgusting!!"


Hey you're quick Steve.
I can't imagine he doesn't record everything.
Hal Mitlitsky wow are you an idiot
"Steve, that is NOT the case at all. What IS vital is that Trump be held accountable for what he says and does at ALL times! American citizens will eventually. have to FORCE him out due to his SEVERE pyschological problems. He is NOT stable, has EVIL intent, is ignorant and disrespectful to soooo many. Not MY representative, not MY President! He SHOULDN'T be ANYONE'S representative! He's embarrassing AND dangerous!!!"

"If he records what he says, then he's a bigger dunce than I thought. That's what brought down Nixon."
A recording is pointless. Remember that Access Hollywood bus tape?
So everyone at that meeting is lying but Trump?  Nice try. What else 'ya got?
Thatâ€™s because heâ€™s a knob!
Yes please so we can impeach him sooner

Steve you have less of a clue than your boy Donald
Notice he didnâ€™t deny the â€œshithole countriesâ€ù quote....
"Ryan Jackson   Thatâ€™s not possible.  He is a TREMENDOUS dunce....I mean really, really TREMENDOUS!"
Good thing that Trump's tweets are are record unto themselves! Great material for election opponents!
Kevin McCarthy   Not even possible....
": ; Word, : ;"
Well I think their mission is to totally destroy this country by any means possible
Chuck Menzies why would we do that?
Do you remember the slogan of GOP?  Take OBAMA down.  Block every DEM or Obama idea.  Mission of GOP.  Pay back time coming in 2018 elections.  Is it a good thing?  Of course not.  Need to work together in bi-partisan way to help the country move forward.  So we need to help Trump by working with GOP after 2018 congress elections.  They will be in minority.
he doesn't need ANY help mate!
actually Steve what he needs to do is what he did Tuesday have it open with the press and put the Rhino's and liberal idiots on the spot that's why durbin is pissed because Trump but him on the spot on live TV and he has to try and redeem himself with his buds
they don't like what he said but can't dispute the acurracy
"Yes, please let him record his dealings so all of these blind trumpanzees can cower in their corner."
"As he should be, before he completely destroys our country."
Steve Martin itâ€™s mind boggling that you do not know these things! SOOO easy to check out! Bet you donâ€™t want OUR President to do great things for us and our beloved country... what does that make YOU?
"Brenda Kettle like what speech did CNN change or cut?  You guys keep blaming the news for reporting things that he has said On Camera and then denies saying.  He even tried to say the access Hollywood tape was a fake, After he apologised for saying what he said.  CNN is not lying, they are actually very factual which is one of the problems Trump has with them.  Trump doesn't like facts or truth, he likes alternative facts and alternative truths.  Name me 5 things they have lied about?"
"Everyone needs to learn to lose graciously. Children growing up today are awarded ""participation medals"" when they lose. Whoever started that ridiculous tradition made a terrible mistake. Every contest has a winner.........They get the medal BECAUSE THEY WON! Losers should be thanked for participation, but to the victors go the spoils. The Democrats have taken the art of losing to a new all-time low. Get out of the way and let the duly elected president do his job, if you don't want to be part of the process of ""Making America Great Again""."
Eric Sears Remembers the former Rapist President Clinton .

TRUE
He's doing a pretty good job of that himself. I guess they're the ones who make the stupid words come out of his mouth though right? You people are so far from reality. Go see a doctor.
Be more transparent and expose those who twist your words
No need to record. I'm sure the microwave got it.
"I agree RECORD EVERYTHING 1 IMPORTANT THING THOITS NOT JUST Recording DEMOCRATâ€™S Itâ€™s REPUBLICANS TOBEWARE OF BOTH SIDES REMEMBER THE SWAMP)Is everywhere"
So true! Mr President you should tape every meeting you have and record every conversation.  Sad but that's the only way your going to be able to keep them honest and on the record.
And they should. Heâ€™s a liar and incompetent for the job.
Itâ€™s not happening fast enough
"Yes, we will not let him screw the nation and just stand by watching."
You may be confused...that is what the Republicans tried to do ty of Obama. Funny how Republicans get their panties in a WAD when Democrats act like Republicans.  We should fire all of them.  If only Trump kept his word and drained the swamp. He just has invited the corruption into the oval office
"exactly right. However, the democrats are so stupid, if the US fails, who will pay their inflated salaries to suck on cigars in their office?"
"Marina Leonardos Really... name 2 lies that the Republicans told about Obama... He sent uranium out of country.. nope, he did that... He sent planeload of cash to Iran.. nope he did tat too... so what are the lies that you are claiming told about Obama... they are not lies, they are truth and facts that Obama was hiding... that is the difference"
Yes record it so the morons that support him can hear the lies
"Melissa Whaley will it keep him honest and on the record?  The Access Hollywood thing was taped and on record and after admitting it was him talking on it, he tried to say that it was a fake.  Even when the press has him on camera saying what he says, he  calls them Fake News."
Steve we can only hope they succeed!
"Mr President..... you already know your every word will be spun and twisted in the most vile way by the liberals.... There out to destroy your presidency.... their operating behind the scenes to bring you down, you must be very careful with every word you say...Myself and millions of other great Americans STAND WITH YOU.....  MAGA !!!!!!"
"Yeah... strange how the word ""shithole"" in reference to Haiti got ""spun and twisted"" into something negative..."
"It doesn't matter, it's his opinion"

Thanks Anthony.  I agree with you other than the behind the scenes part. The libs can be counted on for one thing only. And yes millions do stand with the President.  It will take a lot  of the wrong thing to make us waver and not be supportive.
Your mother is vile.
Agree with you Kenny! Thatâ€™s what it is!
Republicans in the meeting said he called Haiti a Sh*thole too.... So... Ummmm.... Nope!
"Everett Badmarsh he told the truth... the country (Haiiti) has big potential, they need to rise up, agains the ""Lords"" who are making they own people pure and hopeless"

Linda Autry you are delusional!   Enabler!   Shame on you!   This man is Satan himself!
MAGA thank you President Trump for your service to our country.
Anthony my question to you is did Trump spin any of his opponents words when he was seeking the nomination and when he was running for president?
"Riiiiight!!  Keep drinking the shithole koolaide.  We canâ€™t spin the fact that London doesnâ€™t want him to visit or the fact Trump doesnâ€™t know President Bush sold the embassy in London in order to pay for a better one. Thereâ€™s no spin there - but your savior tweeted that it was Obama who did all that. Thereâ€™s no spin on his bombastic tweets that are full of provable lies!!!  Heâ€™s a liar. Just accept it. You love an uneducated, 4th grade vocabulary using, dementia riddled President. Itâ€™s ok.  We understand."
"Everett Badmarsh No it was one of their back-stabbing, lying RINOS.  Just about as low as a person can go.  There is not a single one of those self-righteous jerks that does not say much worse than that every day of their lives, they just don't have a pack of stinking rats making up lies abiout them ecery 2 seconds.  If you are an American, you should be ashamed to the dogs of your attitude toward our President.  Shame onyou and all the rest of your kind."

Correct Mr James! _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
"Bill Best yes because no one has ever said anything, get off the high horse!  Iâ€™m actually more upset that a private conversation is broadcast!!! If you were at a company and disclosed what was happening in a private meeting youâ€™d be fired!  Really does a great job of building trust with other countries, idiots!!!"
"Dale Tucker Dale dear...please tell us how calling other countries ""shitholes"" serves our country...I gotta hear this rationalization from the irrational Trumpanzees"
Thank you holly it's nice to see people still can read and comprehend before Running their mouths ! There's still some hope for the rest of you brainwashed fools
"Holly Williams Waterhouse , please tell me who was in the room? And where did you get the info from? Because it was reported this morning that whom ever was with him have not said that he made that comment.

"Carol LeSaicherre. You are talking about Clinton, aren't you?"

Natasha Bitter. Bitter much? You can't be that stupid and blind too.

Dale Tucker Shame on Trump. You and him are in the minority. You hate. We love.
"Marni, you say fake news. I say evidence."
Susan Janis  coming from a librtard i take that as a complement. MAGA...BUILD THAT WALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Chris Guilbault seriously?  You have a president that canâ€™t speak beyond a 4th grade education level, who canâ€™t finish a complete thought or sentence, who uses words like pussy and shithole but you want to call me classless? GET A GRIP. YOU ARE BEING LED BY A CLASSLESS MAN. WHAT ROCK ARE YOU LIVING UNDER???"
"The ONLY person in that meeting denying that Trump made derogatory remarks is Donald Trump, the most prolific liar in the history of the presidency."
"Mike Wilson oh yes he will. Manafort wants to sue him.  According to Manafort all his actions were disclosed up front.  What is the deal with liberals hating the Russians?  The Democrats dealt with them all the time, but that is ok.  You liberals are such hypocrites and traitors.  Go move to Venezuela and stand on the bread lines."
You liberals are so smug.  Go ahead.  Keep chanting Mueller.  What a waste of time.  Over a year he has found nothing on Trump.  He will find nothing.  He is a total con man.  Just another useless RINO in the WH. We will surely get rid of the RINOS in the next election.  Total losers!
Natasha Bitter he will never get booed!  Trump is s fearless man and a great leader despite what all you libtards say!
Chris Guilbault you will never get a real answer because liberals twist things to fit their agenda.  They canâ€™t admit the truth and act solely on emotion.  Their behavior is disgusting and childish. Republicans are the party with class.  They will never show any class!
"Ingrid Kaiser-Roberts of course I knew about it. And I donâ€™t have a problem with it. A few months ago, I was at one of my favorite spots in Rhode Island â€“ Hazard Rock.

He was an electrician; she was a nanny for a French family living in the greater Boston area. tRump makes my soul hurt _Ÿ˜¡"

I agree with you.
"DaviLyn Morse :You uninformed moron.You are the fake news creator. Nobody said anything against the ones here LEGALLY,Just the ones who comes ILLEGALLY, and wants all the free benefits.

However, inappropriate language is always inappropriate.!! Same thing applies when making 'too many' Tweets.!! ""Off the cuff"" comments can often be an error.

You are so right.  The average Joe gets Trump.  But the shadow government is definitely in high gear to destroy anything good President Trump does.  The media would eat the Trump family alive if they could.  I have never seen such hate.  It is beyond any organized hate organization I have witnessed in my 60+ years.
They're...
"Deb Scott numbers like that over 11,000 Walmart employees lost their jobs yesterday! That piddly pitiful raise was just a PR stunt to try to cover up the fact that they closed so many stores yesterday with absolutely no warning!"
Dave Condit An investigation thatâ€™s been going on for a year. Itâ€™s a sideshow by the Democrats. They are trying really hard to figure out how to throw away a Democratically elected president. What do you think is going to happen? They are going to throw him in Jail and they will crown Hillary? Lmao you will get ultra conservative President Pence. Good luck with your delusional fantasy.

There out???? I think you mean they are out. Hmmmm. Iâ€™m not surprised you support 45. You need to repeat English class.
Dave Condit Yeah watergate had an underlying crime though. This is an investigation looking for a crime not an investigation of a crime that was already proven they just had to link them together. Collusion didnâ€™t happen and btw is not a legal term and there is no law against it so itâ€™s a side show.
Desperate sycophantic deplorables are dumbly deplorable.
You're joking ...right....how can you support this lying swindle g bottom feeder.
Jim MacKey sorry the festering abscess as you stated left office back in Jan 20
William Bush if you support this POS then you are.
How is this twisting his words? Please stop drinking the koolaid and hold this man accountable for his poor behavior. If anyone in society acted as disgraceful as he does you would want them jailed. Why does he get a pass on everything he does? He has excuses for everything and blames everyone else for his poor behavior. Leaders take responsibility for there decisions and actions instead of blaming everyone else.
Patti Cullen whose numbers? Same pollsters who said Hillary would win I guess.

"anyone who still supports this illegitimate potus is a shithole.  trump is a complete embarrassment to the united states on the world stage, but even more embarrassing are the bigots who still support him.  everyone knows they're not true americans.  we can all see the truth. you can call liberals hateful names and blame all the horror of this country on us.  but anyone of any intellectual capacity knows that's all  lies.  trump followers, voters & apologists are the disease in this country."

Why do you hate yourself?
Delmaggio JoÃ«l  lol...you guys are ridiculous....there is only ONE God. He has a purpose and that purpose will be fulfilled by Trump....through God Almighty. Doesn't matter if you believe it or not....it's still happening.
Tisina Barker so.....this time he will get voted out? Last week it was heâ€™ll be impeached. Prior to that it was he will never win the election. Before that......
Linda Fox-Stanley Your point?
Joel Taylor what in world are you rambling on about?
God's going. to bless him but maybe not the way he wants.Trump is part of the devil clan
"Kathryn Roepnack so, God and you have heart to heart talks often? He fills you in on his thoughts? Gotcha."
Rell whitly  and don't use GOD in the same sentence as the ball less spineless pussy GAY muslim we had for 8 do nothing years!
DaviLyn Morse you are so misinformed.
"Nancy, do not use the Lordâ€™s name in vain. God is not guiding Trump. He is disgusted by him. He is waiting for us to drive this heathen out!!!"
"Rell Whitley oh my, still on that false narrative, are we? He didnâ€™t say he grabbed them but merely said he could have if he wanted. Move on. And do your research."
If you really believe in God God loves everybody god is perfect God doesn't like lies so don't say that Donald Trump is Guided by God because you have a rude awakening coming to you remember they will be sheeps in wolf clothing God is good God will not offend anybody he doesn't like lies God bless the United States of America

"Miles Rosen  I am a Christian...to the libs, I guess that equals insanity...LOL"
"Gloria Hawks Simmons lay of the drugs woman, you donâ€™t have long to life this way, I predict. God is love, and if he uses someone, that person would be a shining EXAMPLE showing the world Godâ€™s divine love. He would NOT lie all the time about everything and make it about him ALL the time, so yeah, your God is Satan! F U!"
Go take a sit somewhere _Ÿ˜‚
"Right Gloria, because Trumps adultress, pussy grabbing, cheating working men and women out of money by bankrupting, perpetual lying, nude model 3rd wife, just screams Christian. Gods even laughing at that post.LMAO."

He most definitely should not record. This president needs to be handled. Heâ€™s old! It comes out his mouth before it reaches his brain!! _Ÿ˜‚

AmÃ©n.God bless   thx
I don't think that Trump is the best president  because he wants to ends financial  Aids for Africa
"Gloria Hawks Simmons No not to me, it's just that if Trump asked you to jump in front of a moving train, you probably would."
Agree Nancy.. we have needed him for  a  long time..

"Clearly Nancy Stuch you worshop a God very different than my family.  Mine believes in helping the poor, not passing judgement, and loving all people regardless of their origin, wealth or lack there of or the color of their skin.  The god Trump appears to love demonizes immigrates and the poor, degrades woman, and propogates hate. I can't imagine a Christian supporting Trumps anti-jesus and anti-god positions.  Be honest Nancy, do you really support this man given what he says and does?"
U just might burn n hell w him
"Nancy, you have 771 likes compared to less than 100 dislikes and negative comments. What does that tell you? Keep TRUMPIN!"
DaviLyn Morse publicly? Really?? WRONG!
Terry Kerkman SO TRUE Terry!  I neglected to point that out as well.  Hypocrisy at it's very finest!
"Delmaggio JoÃ«l Newsflash!  God isn't real.  It's a ploy to get people to fall in line and be followers of people that like power.  And, to also take your money!  Wake up!"
"Really?     ""I prefer war heroes who weren't captured"", so what prisoners of war Are less then? how is that a good person let alone a good president?      He is trying to take away government provided subsidies, is that a good person or president?     Believes NATO and NAFTA should be abolished is that a good person?Believes in partisan opposition suppression to progress his agenda rather than bipartisan delegations. Is that a good president? I won't lie he has done a decent job with north Korea and thus far shown restraint, He has done good with helping develop consumer confidence wich has helped the stock market trmendosly, and has taken a strong stance in his america first vision so I commend him for that. But recognize what I did there I showed bipartisan support... Something our president doesn't do. I don't hate trump because he is trump, I dislike him because our political beliefs don't align with eachother. trump haters and supporters both need to learn when to commend, and when to condemn. not everything or everyone has to have a hardline stance it is ok to admit when the president makes a mistake, just like it is ok to admit when he makes an accomplishment... I hope at least 1 person reads this and says ya this guy is right. Give this comment a heart if you're that person"
What's so funny about this statement is Trump don't care about people The Ten Commandments 4 or about him and 6 or about people and if you don't care about other people no matter what what nationality  or race they are then your soul is tainted
Delmaggio JoÃ«l  I don't care what you believe. My faith is MUCH stronger than any words you may have. God Bless President Trump!
The only way tRump can MAGA is to RESIGN!!He is a poor excuse for a man or president!!

Keep off the meth.
He's a great president but he has some crappy advisers and people like Stephen Miller and Ann Coulter. Those goon will keep him from having a great legacy. He really needs advisers like Chris Christie. Or Rudy Giuliani or both

Good point..anyone planning a trip to Haiti? Never crossed my mind...the only way they would vote is illegally since they haven't applied for citizenship

"Jamesy Joseph i think i can answer you ... Just have a status minute ago ... El Salvador and Haiti are not shitholes !!! All balcan countries are not shitholes !!! ,,, The fact that you can kill someone in croatia and walk away free , the fact children in some parts of croatia are hungry in schooles , that politicians are leaches who suck Blood of our nation with corruption and low intellegence , the fact that 900 000 out of 4 000 000 croats are on edge of powerty ... Etc etc ... But that doesnt mean that Croatia is shithole . 200 000 croats leave croatia in last 3 years not because croatia is shithole , its because they want to explore other countries , meet other culture , seek for adventure , ... As a famous croat once Said "" give the man fish , you feed him for One Day ,,, teach that man how to fish and you feed him for whole life"" ... Croatia is One of the most Beautiful countries in the world , with very nice weather ,,,almoust tropical clima on some parts of our country ,,, croatia is on crossroad of east and West Europe , lot of potential from Nature in croatia , Good soil , forests, sea , wind ,Sun ,... So you want to tell me that we are shithole just because a working man in croatia must get a loan from bank on 4 , 5 years for 5,6 thousand euro to buy a car ,,, same car that teenager in Sweden earn for One Summer working just on weekends ? Or we are shithole because we have a beautifull sea and in Summer People from all over the world coming , but croat family cannot aford to make that 1 week holiday and cannot make that 500 kilometer? Well compare to Sweden or Norway or Switzerland ,,,we maybe are shithole ... But we dont want other People tell that to us , or think about us on that way ... Croatian politicians are already determined how much we are smart , its exactly 2 deutche Mark for 1 kilo of our Brain ... So that is preety smart if you ask me ,smart enough to Google el Salvador and Haiti ,,, and to see that they only can dream to be shithole like croatia is ... But i would never say that about Them cause its not politicaly correct . Because if People die on the Streets of Haiti from hunger , and those who dont die from hunger could very easily get shoot by some member of some of the countless gangs there , and their food is monipolized by Clinton fundation , and humans there dont have any human rights , death by some disease close connected to bad  higiene , high rate of childrens deaths and new born babies ,,, its still dont ok to call that or some other country shithole ,,, cause Words can cause much more pain than bullets , hunger , ..etc etc"

God created beautiful places for all peoples. Problem is when people rebel and dedicate the land to demonic forces for personal or national advancement.

Cheryie Wilson yes you have i live down the road from you..BOY
Tammy Gamble Griffin thatâ€™s false Tammy.  I donâ€™t mean offense when I say this but there are Americans that do go there just to visit. Please do not rely on what ppl tell you about other countries. You should visit and see that there are some beautiful places there. ...and some bad areas. Similar to America.
The problem is income inequality.  So all of you defending Trump should probably worry more about the shithole youâ€™re living in and less about immigrants who come her to help make this less of a shithole.
"Exactly my thoughts. The Dems don't want Immigration reform. They do not care about DACA or the dreamers. They Only want more people to become dependent on Big Government therefore, voting Democratic."

They are not of the same mind set as any of you Trump Train people. So your theory about wanting ""shithole"" people for voting Dem is totally moot.

Gofu Mark then why are you in America? Why not stay in your country and spend all that money? I rest mine and The Presidentâ€™s case.
"Exactly Kennneth, why the entire country can't see this is proof they are either already on the gravy train or profit from THE gravy train, namely politicians."
truth
"Trumps kids like those shithole countries, they spent a lot of money killing beautiful animals for trophies. Maybe someone will make a trophy out of them. This whole family is a human stain on the world . I miss Lee Harvey Oswald ."
Jeff Ro:  It's says a lot about our leftist education system in our country that and American is actually defending foreign s***holes over their own country. Ever been to Haiti? Mombasa?
"You are evil.People whose country was entirely destroyed need assistance and you make that out to be an evil conspiracy.The truth is most small business esses are owned by immigrants. Those types usually vote GOP.Have a heart man."
Except for Hillary she spends a lot of money there probably the only country where she can get laid
Joe Billings And the Dumocrats are telling the truth?? Hahahahaha!! It will never happen because they are scurrying to keep their party alive!! They will say and do anything to try and make President Trump look bad! Not to worry because millions of Trump supporters see through all of the crap thrown out there! President Trump will be in office for 2 terms because of garbage like this going on! The Dumocrats destroyed themselves!!
Clinton Grant   Yikes!
TRUE
So true  THAT is how Obama won two terms
"Nope. Democrats know immigration reform is needed, but they also recognize that hard-lined, contemptuous, cruel policies are not what is needed, and that change does not happen overnight.  If cons would approach reform in a reasonable way instead of like a cocaine sniffing toddler with a machine gun, more people might warm to their oh-so-reasonable ideas."
America is too scared now thanks to Obama and Democrats and some Republicans that let this happen we are now scared to leave our homes!
Guess you guys probably want to give RiRi back then?
Haiti experienced a major earthquake and thatâ€™s why they are in such bad shape.. what would you call that? An act of god? Go preach somewhere else
"Quiet Kenneth, they think they are so smart and you are supposed to be too stupid to know that. Don't burst their tiny little bubble, it's all they have."
"Reginald Tyrone Stewart most of us are not rich, we just have to rely on what we see on tv and hear.  People from here have always helped them and tried to teach them. I would like to do that but you just canâ€™t jump in a plane and go there . But seems like nothing gets any better there for some reason."
"DL, you implied a lot there. Faulty logic."
"I consider America to be one of the most dangerous countries in the World (statistics on your own FBI website uphold this view).  Given Americas human rights violations, lack of leadership on the World Stage and the moron you have in office I will not be visiting any time soon.Americans now have the distinction, along with some third-World-countries, of having one of the biggest gaps between the rich and poor. Congratulations!I live 3 minutes from your border."
Rossini Thadal TaxGuru   Leased bu?
"You sir, are a retard"
"â€œGive me your tired, your poor,  your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!â€ù"
"Kristine Shafer, unfortunately the Democrat's idea of immigration reform is to give a free ride on the backs of American taxpayers that will guarantee them generations of anchor voters."
Darren Moran daretobea moron.
"Darren Moran considering Trumpâ€™s approval ratings and his disconnect from reality (yes Gallup polls are REAL STUDIES), most of this country thinks his policies and actions are terrible. The tiny bubble are people who blame a small group of immigrants for their problems because theyâ€™re angry and frustrated by the state of the country and their life and they lash out. like Now if your life is perfect and wonderful i guess im curious - why do you care if they are not deported? Kenneth and many others donâ€™t take responsibility for their lives and blame poor people and immigrants. Not surprising. Itâ€™s been a trend for over a thousand years."
"Kenneth Laskowski, So What?  He wants the fair, blue-eyed people to come, Not the brown ones. And since Norwegians are the happiest people on earth, they are not likely to leave."
Same in Denmark !
"Cheryie Wilson, Why do you think people come here â€œto live off the government?â€ù  What a prejudicial statement!"
"Congratulations Kenny, you exemplify the clown car passengers: dumb as a stone racists."
"Kenneth, not all Dems want to bring in immigrants you fool!!! Dems are INDIVIDUALS that THINK for themselves. They focus on the greater good for ALL people. They are NOT evil, selfish, or unwilling to consider someone else's opinion. They are NOT sheep! Though I am an independent , I admire that!!!"
Nailed it.
Didn't Jim Acosta teach you anything...our immigration policy is not based the on Statue of Liberty's 'poem'... that was an added afterthought...not Immigration Law!
"So sad, so young, so ignorant. Experience and education are your friend, young man. Africa is a continent. People go on vacation to various African countries all the time. Just use Google, little one. It's a start..."
"DL Presswood Yes! 25 years ago I went on my first airplane trip on my honeymoon to â€œJamaicaâ€ù ( it was my husbandâ€™s idea! Even back then(young and stupid) I wanted to go to Hawaii and spend our money in the United States. He wanted to go to Cancun, but I gave in to Jamaica... it was a â€œshitholeâ€ù of a country... and I was never so glad to be back in the United States of America!! Havenâ€™t left since.... He and I did not say the people were, I actually had great sympathy for them... On our literal â€œschool busâ€ùride to our â€œexotic vacationâ€ù compound... Th bus broke down on a muddy dirt road... our window view was pitiful shacks, no bigger than a room set up on cement blocks to keep them dry... the ground was standing in water... these were permanent houses... we entered the gates where we would spend the next week and it was like I imagine entering the gates of heaven.... something beautiful like nothing around... even there we had no water till the next day... and a site wide broadcast suggested going to the pool... we were also told that â€œwe could go site seeing (shopping) or to walk up the â€œfallsâ€ù, which we did, but â€œour safety was not guaranteed from bad people that might steal or hurt usâ€ù. When we got off that bus at the falls, we were approached by multiple men selling drugs.... it was scary... it was a â€œshitholeâ€ù or a â€œhellholeâ€ù as I called it â€œ of a countryâ€ù which is exactly what President Trump was saying."
"Kenneth Irwin,  Great Comments! I agree with you 100%. Thanks for sharing your thoughts!"
"Linda Tagg, in your Ayn Rand world, what does that poem mean to you?"
"Katie O'Leary...The 2016 Election proved polling to be inaccurate!  My life is perfect and wonderful after years of hard work we are enjoying retirement...and love to see that our investments are growing daily thanks to President Trump! Why am I upset?  Because I don't see the same opportunities for my five children and their spouses...make that I didn't see...as President Trump has once again brought hope to our beloved Country!"
"Linda Tagg, wages havenâ€™t increased since Reaganâ€™s good oleâ€™ Trickle Down Economics (failed logic that conservatives still embrace today). Youâ€™re blaming Obama? Lol"
"Monica Monica itâ€™s great to see someone with actual common sense posting _Ÿ™Œ instead of the usual Trump supporter drivel â€˜libtard, Killary, Obummer, emails, evil media, fake newsâ€™ _Ÿ™„_Ÿ__â€çâ™€ï¸è yawn _Ÿ™„ Even bloody Fox News has reported on Trumps shithole comment, and from what I can see online they have had the decency not to  try and flip it onto Hillary.  There must have been a morning show segment on the Fox tv â€˜newsâ€™ or such like, that has brought up the Hillary thing again, for them all to be banging on about it today. _Ÿ™„"
"If that shithole country can't fix there own problems.  It's not our responsibility to take care of them.  Keep going president liberals are getting desperate and crazy,  I love it!"
You ever noticed that the blatant racists are also cowards who hide behind fake accounts?
"No, Cookie, that's not an accurate description of the Democrats approach.  Democrats are open to compromise, and compromise is the only reasonable way to untangle the mess of immigration policy.  Compromise means not getting everything you would like, but achieving some objectives.  When conservatives let go of their ""all or nothing"" mentality and learn the fine art of compromise, then we'll be able to address big problems.  Until then, we'll have huge pendulum swings in policy as hard-headed conservatives take a ""scorched earth"" approach to all of their objectives."
"Unless your family came over on the Mayflower you need to shut the hell up! And even then we stole the land from the Indians.Everyone is welcome!"
"YES DEMS ARE ""MANIPULATORS""  NARCISSISTIC."
Vote for republican put America 1st.
Vote Democrat. Put decency 1st.
"I recommend reading Ann Coulter's book, Adios America!"
"have you been to Africa, seriously?"
"Bigot and Hypocrite. If Obama had said it, youâ€™d be outraged."
"wow are you ignorant, lol both of those countries are beautiful"
Thatâ€™s exactly what Lyndon B Johnson said _Ÿ_”
"What is your background Kenneth? Are you a Native American? ........if not, then just shut up please! All you Trump supporters who are NOT Native Indians. Please.....do us  all a favor and shut the hell up."
Whyâ€™s he lying saying he didnâ€™t say it then?
Sh**tholes like ur president
BINGO!
"Princess Dala go back to your Kingdom  .You know nothing about us or our President."
I repeat ignorance is a crime. Better stay quite
Have you been to the South's shithole? Where white trash literally live off the government tit? Oh sorry....you live there...
Thatâ€™s true just look up the definition for shithole. Itâ€™s because of corruption and we seem to pay more to the criminals then the citizens. We usually get people here now that donâ€™t love our laws but love hand outs and the people (corrupt government) that use them to get what they want
Africa isnâ€™t a country and many African nations have a huge tourism market...
More dem slaves
Eric Weinschenk you hear that on CNN?
"I wanted to visit the little boy I sponsor there but because of all the kidnapping, etc travel there is not advised."
"Randy Lovesky.  Ignorance is denying they are third world countries with tremendous poverty. Ignorance is thinking the U.S. should take in the downtrodden from other countries, yet denying the plight of the poor in America."
Philip Alan yep!!!!
"Jeff Ro; I implied nothing, I stated a fact.  You should learn how to tell the difference leftist."
Eric Weinschenk probably because he didn't say it - as we have seen and heard so many times.
"Lynda Doerksen; Given that weâ€™ve saved the world from darkness on more than a few occasions, you really have no moral high ground on which to preach your idiocy. Also, as a leftist foreigner your opinion is irrelevant.  Stay out of our country if you donâ€™t like it Thot."
"Eve Stevens I live in the ""South"" and love it.  the sh..holes are governed by progressive liberals that could care less about anyone other than themselves.   Detroit ran by dem's is the model of urban failure,  poverty, crime,. It is the poorest big city in the nation, with almost half of the population living below the poverty line.  Look at Flint another failure ran by Dem's for years,... Chicago another liberal failure, St. Louis fourth most dangerous city in the country ran by dem's since the 40's..Baltimore,  Oakland ,Newark, N.J, all sh..holes.."
TRUE
Kenneth Erwin right on!!!
"Actually, it is the Black pockets in the Red States that are living off the goverment. Certainly, some Whites too, and they all vote Democrat! They are YOUR under educated Democrat base, Eve Stevens."
"DL, I see youâ€™re just full of keyboard courage. I see you donâ€™t have a Facebook photo, but Iâ€™ll bet youâ€™re as ugly on the outside as you are on the inside. Iâ€™m willing to bet youâ€™re just another delusional angry old man. A dime a dozen."
"Barb Oglesby, youâ€™re showing that you donâ€™t have a grasp of big picture thinking."
Princess Dala Stay in Ghana then. Criticize your president.
"Kristine Shafer Democrats have nothing to offer but hate. You must be a ""victim."""
"So what youâ€™re trying to say foreigners, most blacks, most females and most gays only vote democratically?"
Batard yâ€™a pas dâ€™allure
How can Democrats be thinking of future votes when the immigrants can't vote you moron! You are seriously retarded!
YOU ARE correct
"DL Presswood you donâ€™t have to ask twice lol:)And as for America saving the World...well the door is still open on that fable. Iâ€™m afraid if you look objectively America has caused more harm than good.So...close your borders and become what Trump wants you to be. An Island unto yourself."
"I realize that you're innocent talking about other countries. You're just repeating everything your media present to you about the realities of poor countries. They always give a simple view of an isolated situation and then develop it for the country in general. However, they never present how they interact in those countries, how they make money, how they facilitate their drug traffic, how they use the citizens of those countries to destroy themselves and after to kill them, how they control their governments to accomplish their dirty goals. Ladies and gentlemen, if the poor countries are shithole, the great countries are the primary contributors."
"It's a mistake to bring in to many people from broken down corrupt societies, because we're importing the problem. The problem is within its people. Cruel truth. You cannot lead a nation with your heart, your heart comes second to your mind."
Thatâ€™s exally right
"You need to question your government about the reason why they choose to establish a diplomatic relationship with those shithole countries. You speak about help, right? You should know the money you pretend to give to poor countries, you take it back when you require them to hire your specialists and buy  equipments from you."
Sounds very familiar to me. Thatâ€™s what Malaysia did and Malaysia is going backwards as we speak.
"You pinned it right!God bless President Trump and America _Ÿ™è_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸"
Your mother is a shithole
"Really, democrats want to bring in people that can't even read or write their own language! And the saddest part is the democrats want to keep them that way, so they can depend on the government(democrats) for ever!"
Exactly!!
Sunny Last god has noting to do with that criminal
Completely True! _Ÿ‡¨_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¨_Ÿ‡º
Illegals should not have the right to vote.
"Jeff Ro: You sound like a effeminate soyboy who screeches like an angry socialist school girl every time someone questions your irrelevant leftist beliefs.  As for how I look, even for a beta male like you thatâ€™s a strange thing to say.  You should go to one of those deviant dating site if you want to meet other guys. Muh....Courage."
Lynda Doerksen: You donâ€™t get to tell anyone what to do.  Worry about Fidelâ€™s love baby PM running your country into the sewer you deviant leftist Thot.
Thatâ€™s right
DL Presswood Oh you noticed Castro Jr has a job up here then!
_Ÿ’¯
"Wrong. People who are kind Christians spend time & money going there to build medical clinics, orphanages, etc."
Sad but True
Truth
Well said Kenneth!!
I agreed with you. Thank you.
"DL Presswood You just stop being a 'difference leftist' [sic], Jeff Ro.Between you and me, these Trumpfucks are incredibly moronic, aren't they.Say, DL, go on back to your meth-addled trailer park and hump your sister-wife."
John Froude I recommend you pass junior high before you attempt reading hate literature by Murica's dime store Eva Braun.
This.
Funny that the only place in this world I definitely never intend to travel to is the USA. I prefer spending my money in exactly what you call shithole. It's entertaining that a continent full of European immigrants (including your president who has German roots) wants to stop immigration. _Ÿ˜…
Exactly! And the Dems are so FN pissed that we are on to them about it. Nothing but a pack of losers and users! Thatâ€™s why God sent us President Trump!
Adam Kitchen
Michelle Rake .  Absolutelyâ€”Illegals should be deported.
100% fact
Kathleen Laucius im sure we could get you a one way ticket to your favorite country.
"What most people are neglecting to realise is that your white over privileged classes were hostile immigrants to a land that doesnâ€™t belong to you, but belongs to the numerous Native American tribes that were there before you. So best you donâ€™t bandy the immigration word around. #facepalm"
"It is a NWO/ZIONIST plan to destroy national identity and weaken countries. Meanwhile, occupied Palestine is for Jews only.  Think about that..."
Bruce Foster: Leftist. I put some in your moms purse this morning when I put her out on the curb with the other garbage.  Iâ€™ll send more with your sisters when Iâ€™m done with them.  Also tell your transformer boyfriend Iâ€™m not into your deviant lifestyle so quit sending him over.  You brain dead Libtarded turd-sniffer.
Jock Watson:  Put a brick in your palm.  Then look at your address.....your opinion is irrelevant. #ForeignPoster
"Exactly, it is really the only way the Dems can win"
Obviously the Clintons have some kind of interest and investment there at the cost of the Haitians people.
"your white people are here enjoying the shithole countries, so travel out nigga amd experience the better view, Africa will work again"
"We don't need you here, bloody paedophile!"
"Walter DQ the clintons stole the relief money from the Haitian people, may be if they hadn't it wouldn't be a shithole country."
"To all of you who agree with your president that Haiti is a shithole, please go to read your real history and ask your ambassadors to give you reports from their daily activities in Haiti."
Billions go into tourism in Africa ....bye

Whether or not we accept immigrants from any country deserves thoughtful consideration of the citizens of this country and should first benefit us so that we can remain the country of opportunity and freedom. It is not wise to just believe we must take every needy and oppressed person from every continent or we will not last long.
What a bunch of moronic racists.
Absolutely true!
Allen Cumbus thatâ€™s right! They need the underclass
Agree_Ÿ‡¨_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¨_Ÿ‡º
Bruce Foster wow!!!!_Ÿ_”
"Suzan, I agree your country can be in some way one of opportunity but not freedom for foreigners. Even for you, your country is not one of freedom. And some of you who visit those shithole countries realize that. Stop pretending that you have the heaven. It's true it's one the biggest countries of the world but not a paradise."
Agreed....They all w ax nt government handouts...
DL Presswood  your comment just underlines the rest of the worlds view about fascists like you and your lunatic president. #godhelpamerica
"Mike Quickenton There was a Republican setting to Trump's right. I will look for his statement on Twitter and post it. BTW, it is quite obvious that the President's 2 day late statement was NOT written by the President."
Thats why some white American men marry girls from there...and leave their own white women
Then don't come here. No one is forcing you
Agree 100%
"Well said, Kenneth!"
Shaddup ya dumb redneck
"Suzan, I'm sorry to hear that from you. You need to delete all conventional acts existed between Haiti and US. And for your information, I'm at home studying and working so hard to change what I can. Never say never!"
I think youâ€™re the shithole Kenneth
"Rossini Thadal TaxGuru  yes, donâ€™t waist your breath talking to this piece of ...."
"You guys should travel more. Hopefully it will open your mind. The US is only 3% of the world population, there is a lot out there. Personally I don't know how must of you do it _Ÿ˜‚. How can you be mad at everything that you don't understand. I can't even stay mad at my wife for a day, and you guys go through life hating people. Think about your health and family."
"People do got to Africa on vacation. Egypt can barely handle the flow of tourist and yet, sh1thole"
Words spoken from a true sh*thole kenneth erwin
Iâ€™m so sick of the media!  Most of us are !!   Time to grow up and get over losing the election.  Time to think of country over your petty feelings democrats !!   Either you are with the country or youâ€™re against us.
They're against you get used to it and quit expecting them to change they will not they are determined to frustrate you for the full 4 years that should be obvious by now since there is never a single rational argument they make but they make one daily nonetheless
"You do realize the President is not the Country right, he is not King or Emperor..."
"Suck my pickle, Angie. Weâ€™re against pos like YOU!"
Jason T. Chambers actually he is while he's in office. Attacking him is the same as attacking your country. He doesn't have to be king or emperor to be the symbol of your nation's strength and/or weakness
Someoneâ€™s triggered _Ÿ˜_ Itâ€™s time YOU drop the Clintons. We donâ€™t care. Why canâ€™t you get that through your head?? We care about the current disaster in office. Talk about growing up _Ÿ™„ Take your own advise. Now take a deep breath and unclench! Itâ€™s Friday!
"Jason T. Chambers to Trumps supporters's he is God... and Trump believes he is.. democracy is in danger, he keeps breaking his oath of the Constitution, that should be concerning to all Americans.."
John Petraitis  how rude
Lee Powell just like Obama was and still is god to Obama supporters. Any other tidbits to enlighten people from all over the world reading these comments?
"Do you see the pattern yet?  Every time we find some truth about the evil of Hillary or obama the media gets some leak from the White House that draws all attention    We found out yesterday that the fake dossier was used to get the fisa warrant.  Which could lead to the shut down of the russia investigation and over throw all findings.   Now do you see ?????"
I can support my country because I love my country.  Unlike the liberals that are still on the â€œdestroy everything campaignâ€ù
You tellem' angry pickle
"This isnâ€™t about the Clintonâ€™s, hun. Time to move on ffs. I feel sorry for you."
"Correction ""The World"" is sick of the media however the best part of all this treatment of President Trump is its making everyone aware he is being treated very unfair and he has even more support the man is a fantastic leader god bless him!!!"
Lol you are just plain sick lol
Michael Lee is a child molester.
People that believe â€œbreaking now â€œâ€˜or â€œexclusive stories â€œ or any media leaks. Are all sad and pathetic
"Kunle Olomofe simply wrong, read the constitution."
Laura Schubert so Hillary should just get away with mishandling classified info?
The media and liberals are all glued to trumps twitter like cats chasing a laser
Zionist owned media pushing the Marxist left agenda. Zionist control facebook too. Keep speaking freely as they will try to limit and control freedom to speak.
Justin McInvale no one has said that _Ÿ_” They need to be investigated along with everyone else. The point is that THIS is not about the f-in Clintonâ€™s. Cons just canâ€™t get over that. It seems like their only focus. Walking around with tunnel vision is no way to live. Itâ€™s ridiculous.
Exactly !
Yep agreed almost sounds like Dems are on a Tyranny streak
"Lee Powell, the President has not broken any oath. He makes an oath to uphold the Constitution."
"What if YOUâ€™re the one against the country, Angie? By supporting the antics of a gentleman acting more as a crazy dictator than a president?"
Dictator ???  You are an idiot.  He is not acting like a dictator.  Obama did tho
Robert Mabe That described Obama to a T .
Time to grow up and recognize youâ€™re being lied to by a crybaby with a twitter account.
Time to grow up and recognize youâ€™re being lied to by a crybaby with a twitter account.
Thatâ€™s the biggest problem why is the media advocating for anyone to win an election America
Definitely against trump and his cult.
Robert Mabe how is he being a dictator? What actions has he taken that resemble a dictator?
Well said... _Ÿ‘ç
Plain and simply the potus is winning .more and more clear thinking Americans are seeing this.  Time will reveal all.
Says angie pickle_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ fake
"Victoria A. Deobald communist president trying to turn this into some kind of communist/totalitarian/Authoritarianism country. Trying to claim the big bad media is lying, saying the only truth comes from him _Ÿ˜‚ can someone say brainwashed? _Ÿ˜_"
"I love America, therefore I'm against Trump. #MAGA, #MAGGOT - Coincidence?"
"HOW can you say that the POS is being treated unfair?? He opens his shithole mouth and dirt comes out. So Denis Buckley, by your support are you in agreement with all the crap he spits??"
Not until this POS is with us.
Fck Trump
"Because most of us absolutely love the media, we greatly appreciate their hard work their loyalty and their honesty to the American people.."
This has nothing to with the election.....how dumb can you be?
Mike Pavone he is with us more than any other potus has ever been.  You are still another butthurt liberal that canâ€™t see beyond your own self pride and hate
You have more wrinkles than iq.
Tamara Robinson-They never seem to be able to answer a question that requires facts.
Vinesh Dutty Ramhit thanks. I earned every one of them
"If by us you mean the racists who think primarily dark skinned populated countries are ""shitholes"" and only good immigrants come from Scandinavia, Angie Pickle. Then yes, I'd agree he is more with you. He's not with me at all."

Thomas Martin catch up idiot.  It was a leak and that leak was a lie to deflect the real story of the day. Which was the fisa warrant was gotten because of the fake dossier paid for by Hillary for â€œopposition researchâ€ù.  Hear say canâ€™t be used in court to prosecute anyone.  So now they must stop the investigation and overturn any charges found
"So dumb!  Either you are with the country or against US?  Hey, Ms. Pickle, all of us are the country!"
Kevin Hutchins then act like it.  Division is nothing more but a propaganda agenda pushed by libera media to make money off you continuing the division
Rebecca Ridge They wouldn't be so bad off if killary hadn't stole there money!
Leonard Hobbs I have friends that went there to help out. They said all the money went to the rich in Haiti not the poor that still live in shacks
Justin McInvale Trump gave classified information to Russians in the Oval Office!!
Jason T. Chambers no he didnâ€™t that was debunked
"""All the money went to the rich"" sounds like the GOP tax plan"
Amen.
"This isn't about losing an election, you idiot"
Jason T. Chambers I can't say I've read your constitution so you got me there. However I was speaking symbolically. If a foreign power tried to kill him or ended up killing him I have no doubt your country would have no choice but to go to war whether he is a much hated president or not. An attack on a US citizen especially one at his level more than likely means war ergo he is a symbol that represents your country. True or false?
Not me Iâ€™m sick of trumps lies

"""either you are with THE COUNTRY or you are against US"" is very telling, Angie Pickle. who is US? and who is THE COUNTRY? are americans who have a different point of view not part of the country?"
"Angie Pickle, how much do you wanna bet the investigation continues?"
Thomas Martin it will it hold water.   You go to court and they use hear say and see what happens
"Agreed! And if you're for Trump, you're against the country! Move out!"
Steve BienSur Gebara you first
"I can add a few more Countries that are shitholes, Afghanistan, Iraq just for starters"
"Angie Pickle, did you read the testimony Glenn Simpson gave? The FBI already had a source inside Trump's campaign telling them the exact same things that are in the dossier.  The FBI was onto the Trump campaign before the dossier and remember the dossier was compiled by a retired British Secret Service agent. Just because a Democrat may have paid for it doesn't it make it fiction written by Steven King."
Thomas Martin no those also were proven lies
Time to stop stereotyping democrats based on the actions of a few angie.
Crystal Livingston more than a few.  Read the comments on any trump posts
"What's the point, Rebecca Ridge"
"Crystal, You spelled most wrong..."
"Angie Pickle, the media divides us? The other day Trump posted on his social media (maybe you mean that media?) ""African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in our country. The Hispanic unemployment rate dropped a full point in the last year and is close to the lowest in recorded history. Dems did nothing for you but get your vote! #NeverForget @foxandfriends."" Do you think that's divisive because I sure do. I also think it'd offensive. He's deporting hispanics, tells that good people March with the KKK and then he wants Hispanic and Black people to thank him for their jobs. Sounds like plantation owner mentality."
Neale Day he knows not the constitution. Read his comments he tries to undo the constitution
"Mexs H. Gruber  She means ""Make America White - and Fascist! - Again""."
Thomas Martin can you name one thing the tRump did to make those things change?  His presence in office didn't do it.
Republican tears are so salty
"Angie Pickle you brain dead partisan stooge the media didn't win the election, they didn't even run.... funny how you never wanted faux news to ""get over it"" when Obama was in office.  You are a prime example of the idiocy that springs from partisan politics ."
Ben Clifton the media pushes their agenda. Itâ€™s why they are still stuck on â€œwhy Hillary lost and following all lies and leaks to fit their agenda â€œ
"No, Rosemary Parker, I'm sorry if anything I've said made you think I'm supportive of his #MAGGOT agenda."
"Angie Pickle, what ""proven lies"" are you referring to?"
Thomas Martin Bernie Sanders please stop posting on my post. Thanks
"Angie who Declared you to be spokesperson and if you donâ€™t like the voice of all the citizens in America then stop paying attention, just deal with it and mind your own business!"
Louise Connor oh I see things more clear now than I ever have in my 50 years.   You should grow up and see the light as well.  You are all being played
"Angie Pickle, this isn't your post. This is your comment on Trump's post."
Me too Angie just sickening âù_ï¸è_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸âù_ï¸è
They the Democrats are against the country. They are for thier own interests a profits. That means they are all in for a world government. Not the American constitution. So are some Republicans. Drain the traiterous swamp!
So I suppose in your mind Trump can do no wrong? Youâ€™re a bigger fool is he is
Thomas Martin then stop replying to me.  Thanks.  Iâ€™m not going to play your games anymore.  Do you really think you will come on here argue with me and change my mind ???  Just stop
Their hatred for our president only makes us dislike and distrust them more!!!!
Deidre Carrell never said that. I didnâ€™t vote for him but he has changed my mind on many great things being done
Linda Sisco Reising amen
After 3 years of hearing about Benghazi and emails...your complaints fall on deaf ears
Youâ€™re Nazi is showing
He is ignorant! I guess he never said â€œgrab them by the Pussyâ€ù either! Oh right. He is denying that when it is clearly on tape.
This is no longer about losing an election... your either for descent representation or your not... trump isn't it...
"Yes you right Angie ,we hurt their â€œpretty feelingsâ€ù saying ,that they lost!Letâ€™s just say nicely:and â€œpolitically correct â€œ...You guys just didnâ€™t Win!They are just vicious!"
"No, Angie Pickle, not really. I think you came here because you thought it was a safe place where the quackery pushed by Mark Levin and the President wouldn't be questioned. Lots of people have called you names, I haven't even though you've called me an idiot. I why you're not asking those calling you names to leave this public forum, but you ask that of me."
Stopped watching fake news in 2008...
"Oh Angie, you are such a complicit, clueless, bigoty bigot"
Sick of people blaming his bad behavior on the media.
"Angie Pickle if you don't like beeing critized when you comment, then stop doing it. Ask people to stop to comment is ridiculous."
Linda Sisco Reising The only one to not trust is Donald Trump
"I think it must be because you can't back up your ""proven lies,"" remark with any ""proof,"" Angie Pickle."
Yes I agree totally
This has nothing to do with the election itâ€™s how he feels about these people in these places
You are obviously against the country.  A Russian Troll by chance?â€_â€_â€_â€_
"So I guess itâ€™s O.K. To call other Countries â€œshithole countries â€œ, right Angie Pickle ?  Go tend to your ferrets. Theyâ€™re smarter than you are Iâ€™m sure."
Right!
"So many ill-informed people, with little education, making stupid statements, about topics they know nothing about."
"No, patriotism doesn't mean following your government and supporting them blindly."
"Only Trump supporters are talking about the election. The rest of us are talking about the ridiculous statements he makes daily, the lies he tells and his total disregard for our allies as well as his antagonistic attitudes with leaders such as Kim Jong-un, risking a nuclear war for all of us."
"Angie Pickle please provide some examples. I'm curious, not looking to argue, but I would really like to know what among his supposed accomplishments are you happy with?"
You mean Trump lost the vote! And your a Russian troll

I feel the same way. We can not let a petty little man destroy our values.

Angie Pickle
Jimmy Contreras you must have voted for Evil Hillary
Agree_Ÿ˜–
"When it became unpopular to be found out as a member of the Communist Party of America, members joined the rank and file of the Democrat Party. There lies the reason for thuggery, lies, and violence coming from the Democrat Party liberals. And most of the MSM is an arm of the Democrat Party. Communists love to control the media and spew their propaganda."
Kara Lee Nope. She's not the one who is fostering anger. She's right.
Supporters of President Trump dont think he is God but we do appreciate him not constantly attacking our belief in God or the choices we make in practicing our faith.
"Hal Mitlitsky Some people like to advertise just how ignorant they are, or is it just an over riding hatred. If one knows anything about Pres. Trump they know he is his own man and always has been. That does not slow down the stupidity though."
Kunle Olomofe _Ÿ™„
Rebecca Ridge  _Ÿ˜_ wrong!
They will never hold office again
Most of you are sick of the media.  The rest of us (the majority) are sick of this orange clown.  Teach us not to show up on Election Day!
Trump supporters are nothing but enablers for the demented president
"You are an idiot, and a petty one at that."
"Robert Tillis, just in case you are that stupid, there has always been freedom of religion.  We plan to keep it that way in spite of trump."
I agree!
"Char Stewart Liberals are not happy, conservatives are happy.Nothing new here."
"Angie, are you saying we should accept Trump as the reoresentative of OUR country no matter WHAT he says and does?! You may be a SHEEP but the rest of us take PRIDE in the America we USED to know. We WON'T stand for his irrational outbursts and sneaky "" behind closed doors"" decisions that affect US. WE are the people our POTUS is supposed to REPRESENT and SERVE not humiliate and embarass! Wake up. Grow up. Dump Trump before he COMPLETELY runs what's left of our country into the ground!!!"
Char Stewart nah not the majority Hillary lost a rigged election and she didnâ€™t win the popular vote either so I would say the minority!!
Judy Johnson Thank God he was elected and overturn all the bad Obama has done to our country!!!
The real shithole is the USA.  A once great country reduced to the laughing stock of the world
You are tired of the media exposing how terrible your vote was and you are unable to rationalize why you actually voted for this clown? I suppose if the media kept covering what a person who I voted for actually said and did and it made it clear how either foolish or terrible I was I would be sick of it too.
"Frankly, if I have to share the country with the likes of you, then treason becomes an attractive option. Luckily, I will merely go on social security, leeching off your tax dollars while steadily undermining your way of life, funneling your money to causes you hate."
Joe Kolakowski Where are you in the demographic you describe?
"funny, did you say this same thing when Obama was President? Can't have it both ways my dear...the media is either always fake or always accurate (or a majority of the time one or the other) regardless of Red or Blue. Trump is not a martyr. He is a manipulator."
"If the media lost its mind every time I said something derogatory, they would run out of ink"
"Nothing to do with the media Angie. We're talking about The President calling countries shitholes and how he has brought shame on the White House like never before by using such dispicable language. Face up to the facts, he's a global embarrassment  and don't be blaming the media, Obama, North Korea or anybody else. Stay focussed on the problem here."
"We know we lost the election.We arenâ€™t talking about that.We talk about his actions since presidency. And thatâ€™s what we donâ€™t like. Only ones who bring up hillary is the GOP. Itâ€™s like thatâ€™s the only card you have to play."
"Angie Pickle - your statement ""you are either with the country or against us"" makes no sense.  Why am I not surprised?"
"Trevor Lawrence - with tRUMP at the helm, it's definitely getting there!  _Ÿ˜_"
Trevor Lawrence Yep...but Trump is fixing that...
Stephan Hyduken Well...you should probably put down the bong and focus more on REALITY and not the liberal voices in your head.
Rosemary Parker I hope you are not trying to give credit to Obama for all the good things Trump has done. Just his winning the election the stock market has risen 6000 points in his first year. It has NEVER risen to that extent in just 1 year.
William Finnerty The only people that are a global embarrassment are you liberals. You are the laughing stock throughout the world.
"Jackie King I am not a liberal!  I am conservative in most things, but this guy is waayyy too much!!!"
Gerry Judice I donâ€™t like Hillary.  I think that is what Trump supporters donâ€™t get.  Itâ€™s not about Hillary.  I am SICK of this guy who has dementia or is just a moron.  Either way I am over it.
Opposing Trump is thinking about whatâ€™s best for the country. Only idiotic children think it has anything to do with Hillary losing.
"Right. Deport, jail, gitmo, execute all anti USA or anti Trump! USA first!"
"How are you going to collect Social Security, when you have never had a job, Ryan Jackson?  Your page says you studied print journalism, but no jobs listed."
Shithole

Nanci Burns most profiles are hidden or obstructed.  You're welcome.
"Angie Pickle Angie, I support your comments and appreciate that you supply logic and fact.  Many liberals and dumbocraps cannot handle logic, ethics or facts.... Sometimes you must hide and block the comments and folks from your website, especially when they try to provoke an argument.  I have had fun blocking many Dumbocrats that replied to your post.  I hope that you have a great day.  Making America Great Again!!!"

"How about listing what you think Trump has done since being elected to ""fix"" our country? BTW the new is not being harsh, they are being truthful, and your man is so thin skinned he can't take any criticism, especially when he outwardly lies about thing he said."
Angie Pickle and which are you?
"The MSM reports his latest tweets and words and actions. They may point out the hypocrisy, flip flop or outright inconsistency with reality of some of Trump's propaganda. That is what a free press is for."
"Its funny Judy Johnson that you say that... as that is exactly how Republicans felt when Democrats had control and expected the same of them. That Dems were just following like sheep before and Rep are now the ones taking pride in bring back the America they once knew and believed in. That Rep are glad to have a President that they feel stands up for their goals.Funny how that works each time the office changes party. Reps and Dems will ""NEVER"" see eye to eye as they are both to busy looking out for their own followers interest (your so called sheep). Party lines always think the other is going to totally destory the nation. Its a never ending cycle."
"Yes, corrupt operation mockingbird."
Ya tell that to Trump he is the one ruin your country.
"Oh we've got over the election we know he's won and now we have to get rid of him as quickly as possible, he needs to be impeached or put in jail his pick because we are not going to stop ever, we will bring him down and he's helping us so much he's making it too easy, it would be easier if the Republicans helped, but without them we have the Mueller investigation and no matter how much he hides like a scurrying little rat we will flush them out and send him on his way so he can play with all the Nazis and bigots that he wants to"
"Boah what cheap rhetoric! ""Either you are with us or against us,... "" Childish."
Angie sounds like she is in a pickle
Margarita Garcia Please don't let you politics to destroy your mind.
"With the country, against you. _Ÿ‘ç"
FACEBOOK FRIENDS ARE ALSO GUILTY OF SPREADING LIES AND GOSSIP....THAT IS REALLY INCONSIDERATE OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING TO BE A FALSE WITNESS...AGAINST ANOTHER...TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE...
"Char Stewart Yes Trump is way too much for the establishment.Neither am I a liberal, just a democrat, was not a Trump voter, but I am happy with our president. My 401k is finally doin great, my farms are much easier to operate after Trump stopped some of the outragous"
EPA and NRCS regulations they were forcing on we farmers. We can now produce more food while making the environment better. We have some making rules who know nothing more than sitting behind a desk an draw a paycheck.
Considering republicans admit he used derogatory words
"Angie Pickle, I'm a Conservative Republican.How do you defend Trumps statements on this subject?FAKE NEWS???Please explain."
Nick Moyte well if you didnâ€™t vote for Trump and voted for Hillary they been showing that ignorant candidate traveling the country and whining and crying and blaming everybody but her own corrupt self!!! Yes we are really sick seeing her whining and crying she needs to go away!!!
"They are against us as an American country, they want us down and out like third world countries, then we can globalize, that's what the libs want!God bless President Trump and America _Ÿ™è_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸"
"Angie, the answer to your problem.stop watchin the news"
It has nothing to do with the media!! Heckle even his 2 top Republican said it!!
35% approval rating is not The majority of Americans.
Donna Call if we had listened to the approval ratings and the polls the Hillary would be our president. These sources poll likely voters in carefully crafted demographics at a time of day people are getting off work and just want to relax. Funny how I've never been polled. Just saying...
Gary Riddley donâ€™t you mean â€œyourâ€ù Nazi is showing?
James Gudgalis sign up for a English class before you make another post.
Angie Pickle posts things and then tell others not to!
I think you have it backwards it seem that Trump canâ€™t get over winning.  Trumpâ€™s behavior and actions are absurd and damaging to the country.  What makes me sick people that done understand what a democracy is really about.  Take a civics class and read some founding fathers history for of God try to know something.
"The media didn't run in the election.  You don't represent ""the country"".  You represent about 25% of it.  The other 75% didn't drink the Kool-Aid."
well said Angie <3
"Most liars are sick of the truth as it does hurt. You guys are always using the pathetic excuse that the liberals can't get over the election. Spare me please...it's just as sorry today as it was yesterday, and honestly getting old and boring. I do agree that it's time to think of the country first not one man, not liberal or democrats, but the country and we the American people. So look in the mirror Angie pickle when you tell some one to grow up."
"Roseanne Napier-Riddick if anyone needs some education sweetheart itâ€™s you.  First you need to understand English and sentence construction so that your rants are somewhat understandable. Second, if anyone needs a civics class itâ€™s you............. we are a Republic not a democracy.  Read a book and have a nice day you liberal loon."
"No need to defend yourself to me, President Trump. Don't pay any attention to those who seek to bring you down.  Keep doing the good work you are doing.  The American people appreciate you"
The President of the United States works for the American people. He/she does have the duty to answer to us. He is not a dictator.
Vanessa Stoddard Childs LOL most Americans are retards so no he doesnt have to and shouldnt
Loser
Jimmy Rockford shut it troll...  retreat to the basement where you obviously thrive.
Yeah Vanessa most Americans are retards they selected Donald Trump as president what a s******* country we live in
God bless Trump God bless the United States...oh and screw the left and their puppet   CNN and MSNBC!
Jimmy Rockford Interesting that least educated voted him in. Are you one of those retards?
"God rejected him even before he was elected, his like a refuse just waiting for President Wilson from texas"
"No president, ever has been subjected to such disrespect.  I'm amazed that he continues to move forward and has accomplished so many good things for the American people."
He is single handily accomplishing that...25th amendment
"Muhire Bright Rodz Wait, what?"
Poor Carole thinks Trump was talking directly to her. Precious.
Carole Purcell Domasco I have said this many many times.  God is certainly with him all the way.
Keep up the good work President Trump! God bless.
"Vanessa Stoddard Childs, still believing MSM lies that poorly educated elected President Trump?Trying to make yourself feel better about yourself because you chose a candidate that couldn't defeat a ""TV personality""?What does that say about YOUR choices in life?Poorly educated doesn't mean stupid, it just means they didn't spend years in college for a useless degree (and student loans)."
"I am brazilian and latin and I wanna say Trump is the best president of USA!#GoTrump God bless you"
Obama was never bashed as bad as trump right?
"Vanessa Stoddard Childs, plenty of doctors, lawyers, and other highly educated people voted for him."
"Jeff Sandt, you should read up on procedures to use the 25th. It is highly unlikely the crazy left could ever make it happen."
"Look how much the Clintons have done for the Haitians.... they're still WAITING for that help, but it paid for a wedding for Chelsea and made their bank account bigger..."
Put the crack pipe down!
"Carole Purcell Domasco  accomplished what? Are you talking about all his claims that have been proven to be lies? He is disrespected because he, himself, is disrespectful."
Trump is mentally ill.
"The real question is that who in their right mind would make something like that up, this is not about democrats verses republicans, it's about morals, the fact that his supporters keep on defending him over every one els is just childish."
"Well Biden woulda thought this was a ""f'n big deal."" ;)Oh the selective morality of the Democrats....."
"Carole Purcell Domasco we the realAmericans stand by him!"
Muhire Bright Rodz first of all God doesn't reject anyone.
America is cursed. We watching..
"This is what Trumpy is:Sh*thole"
Vanessa Stoddard Childs retards are those who believe that. I have a college degree. I think people who didn't vote Trump are very dumb and no education can bring them to a higher level.
Jere Gallimore Wow.  that took a lot of thought.
"Wow. Pay attention to what he is doing, he's bringing our country down!"
"Vicki Randolph Chavez get a clue Trump is President, the Clintons have nothing to do with Trump's ignorant comments. By the way he also included Africa in his comment. Africa where the U.S. has 15+ military bases. He is a complete idiot!"
Carole Purcell Domasco he earns it all by himself !!
Jere Gallimore what a hypocrite.  You can say it but Trumps can't?
Cindy Stormont Keith are you delusional. He has accomplished more in one year then our last Presidents did in 15 years. What did Obama do?
Rebecca Godek our Country was taken down for the last 16 years. Started with Bush and Obama almost accomplished it! Trump is putting America FIRST
Rebecca Godek He is bringing our country down?  I guess you know nothing about the economy huh?
Trump is a legend. Some times hearing the truth hurts especially if your a snowflake ....
Marni Hamilton Allen Ur insane
Sherry Rivenburgh soooo boring and unoriginal wow
"Vanessa Stoddard Childs, America voted Trump in, Black white, poor rich.  who won South Carolina??  The state with the largest percentage of registered black voters?  Who won Arizona?  The state with the largest number of registered latino voters?  you beliefs are dead wrong!"
Only the rest of the world laughs at you
"Rebecca Godek  please explain how our beloved President is bringing our country down? Stick with facts please, I know thatâ€™s challenging for your kind... canâ€™t bring down the country any lower thanks to Obama. Good riddance."
"Poor Liberals.It must be a SAD life to chose to be miserable everyday. Signing onto a Facebook page that upsets you and yet find joy in upsetting others.What kind of mentally ill person would do that to themselves? Guess ""Love Trumps Hate"" only applies when you are told that you will win?"
"What has he done. Tax cuts will flop just like they did before. Other than that he's done nothing except be a bully. Hope he's gone soon, so we can make this country great again. Hopefully all who voted for this moron, fall hard. Have a good day idiots."
Snowflake's are up and crying I see today I love our president  he says what everyone is thinking go to your safe zone and do some color let the adults talk you  whinnying snot nosed babies go trump trump 2020 another round of Kool aid for the snowflakes
*implying American people as Trump supporters* lmao

Linda Grilli Are you serious? He has done more in one year than any President in the twentieth century. What did Obama do?
Linda Grilli  guess you would rather have killary up there. you lost now suck it up.
Vanessa Stoddard Childs that's the most ignorant statement. I can assure you that the majority of the people who voted for him are far smarter than you_Ÿ˜_
Muhire Bright Rodz Stupid statement. God sets up ALL the leaders and tells us to pray for them.
"Thaddeus Swiger obama was the lefts messiah. The media never bashed President Obama, he was their darling."
"Carole, totally agree! Dems, the Satanic party of slavery, kkk jim crow lynching use the Alinsky tactics of lying & accusing.  This works on the Dem slave base & gullible or ignorant others but not on FREE ppl. God bless Trump & spoil his opposers."
Cindy Stormont Keith you just lied
"Jacob Johnson democrat leaders are the last people that should say they take the moral high ground. They have called President Trump every name in the book, they lie and twist and outright ignore the truth."
Vicki Randolph Chavez yes they haven't a moral leg to stand on.
Desiree L Sires _Ÿ˜‚didn't it? Jere has nothing of substance to add to the conversation.
Linda Grilli wow to be so uninformed in this day and age. Research it and you will see all he has accomplished.
"Karen Sharpe That would be because he was a good, moral, decent man.  Not a despicable thug such as trump."
"Linda Grilli that just shows what a hateful person you are. If you live in America and America falls you will too. If you don't live here,you have no valid opinion. Ad hominem attacks just shows you have no facts. All emotion."
Nancy Harris yeah riigghhtt..  _Ÿ‘Œ_Ÿè_
WHAT good work?  Robbing the poor and needy with his tax reforms?  Taking away the affordable care relied upon by millions?
"We ALL heard what he said. â€œI have a wonderful relationship with Haitians.â€ù Yep, sounds like it. _Ÿ_£"
Carole Purcell Domasco It isnâ€™t unsolicited. He spews disrespect. And deserves none in return.
"Vanessa Stoddard Childs, you, like many liberals, confuse knowledge with wisdom. Education gives you knowledge. And for most people who are educated with advanced degrees, those degrees are in a specialized field that has nothing to do with world affairs. A PhD in anything but a government related field means nothing, and even those that are do not create wisdom, only knowledge.Wisdom is the proper application of knowledge."
You are the minority soon to be silenced by the majority nazi boy
Donald Trump is your president Bill Muller
Scott Doscher But first you need knowledge. And as Trump is clueless and LIKES it that way...
CARRY ON SIR! MAGA
so sais the 32% of Americans about this rapist
"Neil Kyte nobody robbed the poor.......... Affordable care act hurt way more than it helped.Do some research."
"Karen Sharpe the Democratic party fake outrage and moral high ground as well as overly political correctness is a form of control. Thanks to our constitution which protects us from more overt means of dictatorship the Democrats have devised things such as identity politics and being offended by everything in order to try controlling people and telling them what they should do and how they should think.Some of the very same sheep falling for this are on this very post, they're usually complaining about the ""millions"" of people who lost Healthcare but leaving out the fact that Obama made a mess of it and it hurt way more than it helped... Or complaining that wealthy people gotta bigger tax break than the poor, while conveniently leaving out the reasoning behind it.Thank God this lie isn't working on the self thinking Americans who want to preserve our country for our grand children."
"Yeah, sheâ€™ll suck your dick no matter what you do."
Pres Trump I even if you did say those words it would mean your not lying about it. I am truly greatful to have you as our nation's president and like I have read in a previous comment pay no mind to those who seek to tear you down they are the nay sayers that will cry like little babies over anything they don't see bennifet themselves.. I support you 110%
I dont appreciate President Trump. Therefore you are incorrect

"Hamidreza, you ARE just like Trump- CLUELESS!!!"
"Haha, he gave up nothing! I threw up in my mouth at your ""so humble"".  It's folks so easily fooled that got us this dick head for a president!

Lying Orange Turd!
Your as dumb as his daughter a rock ! Say no more.
"Pat Englund Pat... I do not like DJT 'wording' that is the news right now.. in fact he Tweets OK 'but' tweeting too much about any issue 'is too much'..!! However he did not 'diss' any person in this recent comment, just mentioned areas of the world that a lot unrest lawlessness & problems.. the word was inappropriate."
"Can't decide if this is sarcasm or sincere.  That's how divided the states are right now, well guys, you had a good run."
"But do we want an authentic leader or a paid and polished puppet, Jason Humphrey? Yes there are different, more ""politically correct"" ways to say things, but the president is adamant and doesn't mince words."
Hated by losers and leeches and democrats who have been living off the hard working class while appearing to tend to those losers they have done nothing for other than throwing chicken feed for votes and power.
"Stable genius,  just like Mr Ed"
"Pat Englund that Pat is an excuse for anyone to say anything and defend it by saying I'm speaking my mind or not mincing my words, a ridiculous argument and you know it. He sets the moral bar for the country, and never has it been set so low."

Wake up and start thinking and appreciating the honest of his commitment.
"dude your profile is fake as hell, you appear on all his comments and immediatley get 1K Likes. Trump social media team, you are FAILING. Badly."
Sorry for the typos etc. I saw them but in my haste  didn't correct them....soooooo those of you who have nothing to add don't need to point out my errors and make the USUAL DEROGOTORY comments when you have nothing substantive to say in your defense....
"""SUBSTANTIVE"" ouuugh ! ...I think I created a new word. It works but I'll have to look that one up...."
"Darlene Martindell You do realize this is not about the cussing.  You really have no idea the ripple effect things like this cause in international relations, do you?"
Ain't it the opposite of Robin Hood to screw programs for the poor in order to give millionaires tax cuts?

Where did you get 20%.  Hillary won the popular vote!  And now trump is at 34% approval!  I and my son are both ex trump supporters! I myself am tired of him lying to we the people!
Thank you. Donald Trump is a GREAT President. Some people love to pick apart anyone who is above them. Sad there are some people like that. Jealousy does that too. Creates Hateful people. So these people will also find fault in someone. They can't be happy for a person who represent what they are not. Jealously. Some people will talk bad about a person no matter how great that person is. Hate. Go Donald Trump #MAGA #mypresident #prouddeplorable #DONALDTRUMP #ourpresident #MAGA #GODBLESSAMERICA

Thank God for our president!  He's getting things done, in spite of the haters going against it all.  Things they ran on when running for office.  They don't care about our country. They just hate what President Trump is getting done, and he's getting it done in spite of them."

I could go on and on with other Presidents re nasty matters...they are human.

Mike Ellender No...I listen to Fox News for fake facts...
Have you ever been to Haiti
Their governments are corrupt? Thatâ€™s a laugh look at us. The worlds looking at us. Itâ€™s not the American people that are on trial here it is our president. Ripping at the fiber of what made America great
"Deidre Carrell What made America great is God, and the Founding Fathers of our Constitution, which Obama trampled over with a disrespect that I hope we never see again."
"Ken Bates I just did...Of course you will say ""fake news""  That's because the Fathead has you programmed to believe anything he says.  You cannot think for yourself thus you live you life vicariously through the most corrupt President in the history of the United States.  Justify it to yourself anyway you want.  You're the one that has to tell his kids that you voted for this moron five years from now."
"Moise Luc Twice, actually."
Marco Costanza how did Obama trample the constitution?
"Mike Ellender look above...Of course, being a Trumpie lover...you will do the ""Fake News"" whine...Not everything is a conspiracy theory that Sean Hannity tries to tell you every night on the Trump propaganda station.."
Mike Ellender you put the explosion of a nuclear bomb as the picture on your page.  You are a sick individual...
"Aw, look at you flappin' your shithole!"
The list I put up is just from March of 2017...the Liar in Chief has been the victim of crap mouth thousands of more times since.
"Angulluaq Oldman :Eastern European countries used to be called â€œshitholes â€œ under the socialist and communist regime, and not the people. And they came LEGALLY, and ready to work, not to be parasite and burden of the taxpayers money!Let them stay in their country, and make their country great, orcome LEGALLY!!!Whatâ€™s wrong with this picture â€œOldman?â€ùAnd YES God bless President Donald Trump!!!"
"Your a RENOB ! Asswipe ! Letâ€™s see I do home health .... and the care takers Are from Africa ... who take care of disabled , abuse women , and people with mental disorders .. oh I forgot to tell you they are Americans who are the patients ! Dickhead your a shithole"
Bob Kroner and they get good healthcare
Brad Davis buy a girdle...
"And to take your comment a step further, they want to come here and turn our country into a s***hole too."
Agree
America is still the biggest shithole with that fatass sick jerk as president _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚
Kare Feil you ever hear some of the things LBJ or Nixon or Bush said..
Which part of Haiti?
Arenâ€™t you a repugnant white POS!
Remember where your shithole ancestry came from
Trump has made America a s******* soon as he leave things will go back to normal please Mueller hurry up and get this sick twisted son of a b**** out of the white house before somebody blow his dick off
Angulluaq Oldman my ancestors didn't come from Haiti
Stop the 3rd Worldization of America!
"They are S...holds because they are run and ruined by socialist dictator, like Hillary would have been."
"Heather Bradford well, maybe not. But the devil is a smooth talker, so I would rather have an honest sometimes brash President who loves America and her people, than a smooth talking President who sells us out to the very countries who want to annihilate us.*cough* Obama"
SHITHOLE trump!!!
Stewart Fritchman But you are taxed 45% or more in taxes and free healthcare sucks when you have to wait months to be taken care of. You can also be denied.
"There you said it, they want to come here for a better life, what is wrong with that?"
Bob Kroner oh well
Teresa Grider McInturff Sands America is the best country
Wtf
"Stewart Fritchman Nice Try more then 1/2 the America fishing Fleet , is from or  their Parnets are from Norway ."
"Your god said he did not say that word, so, are you going to retract yours now too? And repeat what and how wonderful his words are? For a change, I can witness a wonderful word coming from a Certified Trumpster like you. _Ÿ˜‚"
Dan Provost not so
Dan Provost That was a PROVEN to be true. You see the mainstream media used footage from BEFORE the rally started. So the media LIED not President Trump. Fact check
Marco Costanza God bless them
Dan Provost you are kidding right?
I was there a year after the earthquake. Thereâ€™s no other way to describe it.
Angela Dell Clark.... yes you're right what some people don't even know some Americans that base in Haiti for work they make more money than you making here in the state.
"Haiti is pretty much a wasteland. They had an earthquake,  a hurricane,  another hurricane,  and another hurricane."
A Republican in the era of Trump talking about other governments being corrupt... Bwhahahaha
"Reginald Oandasan, some of these people like Esther Mark the dressing like us, walk like and talk like us.But they not humans in heart."
"Like the case of Nigeria, a fantastically Corrupt state..."
Corrupt government makes a country a shithole? America must be the biggest then lol
"Rafael Amely thanks for answered this guy cause he is immigrant and talking like that about the Haitian, he's heart is garbage that's right.Talking like he's the only one came here LEGALLY! And became an Americans.One word for him he's an idiot."
Haiti would be in better shape if the Clinton's hadn't stole all their Relief Money....
Lol like the USA Government is corrupt your living in a dream world slave
"Marco Costanza nothing at all wrong with the people, mostly warm and very nice, but i too have been to many of these countries and i sure wouldnâ€™t ever want to live there."
Disgusting bigot
"Marco, are you the OFFICIAL interpreter of the POTUS?! We INTELLIGENT Americans don't need an interpreter. We UNDERSTAND how ignorant, offensive, and CRAZY he is. DUMP TRUMP!!!"
Amen!
"You should get out a bit more. See the world, that kind of thing."
Troll
"Dan Provost I bet you wouldn't say that if Oprah were to win...she's a Billionaire who might profit from being President too...Also, Obama and the Clintons made millions being President...I don't hear you complaining about that either!"
Karen Sharpe what the hell are you talking about?
"Maybe it's high time we chase away your companies  Marco,refuse also your USD and see what becomes of your country"
@ken steinfeld nobody has invited you ha the  world is bigger than ur so called country .
"Say a person who have never left their trailer park. Been to Haiti beautiful country, beautiful, honest, smart people."
Sia...gyimiii
"Marco Costanza Trump just said a big whopper today...did you carefully see his mouth say he never called Haiti a ""shithole""...I know, it's tough when you find out that your hero is really a moron...need a hug snowflake?"
"Dan Provost do you mean countries rather than states?  He might be ignorant, which is temporary, you on the other hand appear to be leaning toward stupid...stupid is permanent!"
Marco u are mad... u are very stupid ...who the hell do u think u are ?.....
Douglas Nail you are both stupid and ignorant...justify it to yourself any way you want...Tell your kids that Trump called a continent and country a shithole...I'm sure you're a proud white guy who wants it to be 1950's America...Let the adults do the talking...
"Douglas Nail I just looked at your profile picture... I think the word idiot must be added to a description of you...Thus, here it is..."
OMG Trump said shithole. At least he wasn't sticking cigars up a poor 21 yr old intern. Hypocrites
"Shhhhhh! Democrats don't like the truth. They prefer to pretend shi#hole countries with corrupt, gangster run, dictator governments and 3rd world cultures are just as equal as any other goverment and culture. They prefer to believe uneducated people forced to live anyway they can, often by criminal and violent means, are just as culturally equal as spoiled, educated, much richer and safer Western civilizations cultures are. Let's all pretend that is true. It hurts Liberal brains too much to try to think their could be differences."
I guessed u ain't know what are u talking about u should know better about Haiti we made histories and we fought for America
"Barb, have you ever heard of the School of the Americas?  Look it up. Read about how WE made those countries ""shitholes"", and then edit your post as needed. We trained their dictators.  Noriega?  A graduate from that school.  El Salvador, Guatemala, Chile had their murderers trained by us.  Please educate yourself a bit before spouting statements like that."
So why did you leave your country Costanza?
Please if that is your standard you have major mental issues.
Dan Provost grow up!  Take some anger manager and go back to work.

Trump's statement was not enough. Africa is a trashy continent because of her leaders. I think it's high time we constructed a constitution to eradicate these big stomachs who call themselves leaders in Africa but only care about themselves.
Keone Tiny Majeremane you're talking to the wrong crowd. Americans aren't trying to leave...
Aguvasu Willy yes it is
"Cody White ... No, your country is the one who create the war and unrest, supports terrorism and regime change, civil war; that makes it possible for tyrants to rule, the very reason there are refugees.  If you don't know that, then you deserve to be totally ignored, discarded.  No one ever blames the refugees except heartless punks of hamburger who haven't a heart or a brain.

In Botswana we will chase away americans military bases will be closed no more diamond to america we can do without America. They are looters thirds and evil.if all countries in the world can close american embassies and chase all Americans back to their Sodom and gomora .the world will be at peace and america will loose and be humbled as they will have no influence on anyone. They will crash as they will not have enuff resources to service.
America & Trump are the Robin Hood of the what cld ve been of America if not benefits of corruption & looting from Africa. There are shits in the holes and America & Trump are the shits.
This is totally out of order....Americans are not better than Africans....
They are what u say because During the industrial revolution you Fox came here and dug out all our

He also told me anyone with any sort. Of money all buy armed body guards. He also told me Haitians hate the Clintons with a passion."
So?
So I would be willing bet it is a shithole.
Sounds like a shithole
The clintons turned that shithole country into an even shitholier shithole
He told you what you wanted to hear because you can see your ignorance
Heather is a liberal snowflake
Because the Clintonâ€™s stole the donation jar off them.
The people outraged because Trump called it a s*** hole are the same ones that ignore the fact that the clintons turned it into one.
Jack McGloughlin what an ignorant comment lol. He told him that bc he has lived the life there. Man you people are so delusional itâ€™s absolutely hilarious _Ÿ_£_Ÿ_£
Would you prefer to leave your Haitian coworker there?
Bobby Hudson people are in absolute denial. Iâ€™ve seen dozens of accounts of life in Haiti and itâ€™s all the same description. A literal shithole.
Trump would not leave him there and why is because he is a engineer

"I am Brazilian and latin and I support  Donald Trump! !#GoTrump The best president of America!A great man, a true christian! !GOD is With you, Mr.  PresidentThe evil ( fake news)will never wins!"
So funny. He didn't say he wanted educated Norwegians. I wonder why.
Woe nonfa you dey talk
^^Most uneducated statement ever!
"Is it poor - absolutely. But the Haitians are finally started to rebuild. Theyâ€™re such hard-working and tough people. Many have to walk miles a day for drinkable water. Their government is corrupt and the police are non-existent. I never once felt my safety was in question. Is there crime? Absolutely. But most of them love Americans and we could all do something to help them. Rather than donating to foundations that give the money to the corrupt government and itâ€™s never seen by the people - give it to Haitian churches that are building wells, schools and creating jobs."
Still Sounds like a shithole
So itâ€™s a shithole??
"I grew up there.  It is a very difficult place to live, but the people are still people."
Alice Goldstein donâ€™t know IF he said that but would not have to include the word educated - it is a given.
and i'll bet they just love donnie dotard
They do hate the Clintonâ€™s
Alice Goldstein  maybe because they are educated?
True...
And what does all that have to do with Trumpâ€™s inappropriate remark?
Jack McGloughlin prove it
Just had to throw in the clintons in there
It's true.  Your words have been corroborated time and time again by others who have been to Haiti.
"It is the only 4th world country in this part of the world. Itâ€™s incredibly poor, but parts are absolutely beautiful. I would never call it that because the people are absolutely some of the best Iâ€™ve ever met. The resorts are gorgeous too which is sad to see them and then the poverty the families live in."
Dawn K Ritzie...Sooo in other words you're saying it a 3rd world Shithole...Thats all you had to say...
"Linda Fox-Stanley That's what people who have been there call Haiti and other places around the world.  It is a s...hole.  It's the place, not the people, each of whom is loved by God."
I know people who have come here from Haiti and of course itâ€™s a shithole !!! Geezus people we ALL know that !!!! People live in squalor and their leader lives like a king . Liberals are beyond comprehension. Remember Haitians live in squalor while Hillary their queen stole millions that should have gone to help them .....
"Carlos Blanco Escobar It's the truth.  Haitians HATE the Clintons... and who would blame them for what ""Billary"" did to them!"
Dawn every resort is guarded by armed guards.
"Nathanmark Purvis Grow up, idiot."
"Luiz Correa I suppose compared to the presidents youve had in Brazil of late hes a great president,but thats just because we are dealing from a very low bar of expectations."
"Debbie Letai Look who's talking about what's inappropriate:  Someone who worships the Clintons and their political offspring, Obama."
"Eric Schulze, please, enough with these stupid pictures."
"Luiz Correa, thank you! Finally someone with a head on his shoulders!"
in washington  DC  some protesters dress like vaginas in the the government they act like offended  vaginas
"Junior Lambert you may think so. I loved it all. I canâ€™t wait to go back. And if my husband would be on board, Iâ€™d move there. Itâ€™s a tougher life for the basics, but itâ€™s an amazing life with wonderful people. Thankfully, there are finally people dealing with the trash. There is no garbage system there. But organizations are finally going in and helping to remedy it."
Wayne Johnson the resort I was at was not guarded by armed guards
"Nathanmark Purvis, and I bet they would just love that name of yours! You donâ€™t call our President â€œdonnie dotardâ€ù, itâ€™s disrespectful! Whether you like him or hate him, he, you should respect the Office!"




"Africa has been in a real bad way for decades. Many thousands of children drinking river water that's also giving water to their wild life, as their cattle, that stand in the water and other thing they do while in the water. Yet these people drink the water cause they are hungry. 85% of Africa isn't developed as their cities as Johannesburg, Cape town, port Elizabeth and others have nice homes, cars, high rise building apartments. Jobs, air conditioning, fast foods, grocery stores. Safari trip resorts.Porta Ricoh is in the U. S. And it's the same way. A few cities there are for the wealthy. As to the others that don't live in the big cities.Yes if Trump did say it which he's not denying but he's made a promise to America, that we are first, not other countries. If we don't get out budgets in place and our government to stay under their budgets out country will be in trouble.We can't rescue all the needy, if we can't get our bills paid.Give our president a  break. Get off of his back and concentrate on his job."
"And yet, how much you want to bet that even Haitians think it's a shithole....especially after what the Clintons did."
LOTS of videos on YouTube with actual interviews with Haitians on the hiLIARy facts.  https://youtu.be/4PeO0SfCw5s
"Haiti like Mexico has some amazing beaches.  Most resorts built by American investors.  We go their and spend a fortune.  If you are fortunate to work at one of these resorts you do well. If you travel outside of the resort area,  well yes its a shithole.  I feel for these ppl the way they live.  They are the ones trying to come here for a better life.  I blame their government for not taking care of their people.  The  government officials live very well."
Carlos Blanco Escobar I guess the truth hurts.
Dawn K Ritzie bye bye and once your off on your own there who will protect you then ??
Carlos Blanco Escobar Where have you been Clinton's stole money from them that was suspose to help them.
"Yep, go Clinton foundation. _Ÿ˜•"

"The last one you just made it up, other than that you shouldn't actually have problem with Haiti system of not having ambulance and all, isn't that socialism?"
"Yep, i have a friend who does missionary work there. Said the conditions are horrifying."
Edward STFU you idiot
"All.i will say is.  Those who still Support the Clintons and Obama will never change. Also. Go to these sad and deprived countries YOURSELF, live there for a few months and see what it is like . Then come back and compare"
"So, Charyl, you are obviously for letting Haitians keep their TPS status, yes?"
Karla what country are you referring to in Africa? Or are you suggesting the continent is 85% undeveloped?
"Aka, it's a shithole."
"Well, there's my #metoo!"
100% shothole! All sunny places with shady people!
"Ummmm in the US the ambulance comes and then you go into debt for the medical care you received. Or how about we talk about our disabled citizens losing coverage for caretakers. Young people, who can and want to work, who are using GoFundMe to pay for caretakers just so they can work and have a life that is not lying in bed all day. America is not perfect. We just have more wealthy people. But we also have a lot of poor and destitute people who'd probably call the US a shithole."
Jack McGloughlin have you been to Haiti?  No? Then stfu
"Monica at least you live. I'll take medical debt over death any day. Yes our health care definitely needs some serious work, no doubt."
"I loathe the Clintons as well but NOT as much as the POTUS. He is a "" FAKE"" President and an imposter as a human being."
"I heard they hate the Clintons too, Not sure why"
In other words Wayne Haiti is a shithole
The world is a mess but America needs to fix itself 1st. CHARITY begins at home.
Judy Johnson Tired of these Bots posting negatives and they say  Russia did it....LOL
Re Waters go back and re read my post. I gave you a few cities. That are developed.
"You said Africa which is the whole continent, you listed cities so maybe be more specific if you are referring to individual countries when making a statement that Africa is 85% undeveloped."
"Sherri Sontag the U.S. is first to EVERY countryâ€™s aide, but yet we are hated by the very people we help!!! They bash us till they need us!!"
Richard Getman she supposedly stole money from the earthquake fund that was set up
"Wayne, Sounds like Fake News to me!!!!"
It depends. The cities aren't horrible but pretty much everywhere else is
Craig Smith... Supposedly?    Hahaaaa  You always believe what the fake news media tells you too?
lol.. the Clinton part.. was hilarious
"Re Waters, the undeveloped land in Africa. Sub Saharan Africa, 48 LDC'S  33 of endemic poverty, diseases and instability.Guinea. Mozambique, Congo, Liberia, Niger, Eritrea,Malawi, Burundi, central African Republic, Madagascar, Comoros, Togo, South Sudan, The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Central Africa Republic, Mozambique. That's not all of them you want more you go find them."
"Judy Johnson I loath the Clinton's as well.  Lets hope, your Billionaire T.V. personality with no political background can match up to Trump.  ROFLMAO."
Well I just saw my Haitian doctor today who since become an American and he feels such shame with Trump in the White House and the crimes that Americans have committed in Haiti under this president and I understand this president is such a bigot daddy gives white supremacist a bad name
WOW..looks like a lot have forgotten how all of us who voted TRUMP  PROUDLY... had to TOLERATE Obama for 8 years.. Its our turn. Get alife and get off facebook. to many of you troll Facebook looking to be MEAN TO THOSE WHO DISAGREE... TOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Trump lovers really need life.he could piss himself in public and you would swear a dem threw water on him
"Arsalan Ahmed why do you say the last one is made up? The Clintons royal f'd the people of Haiti, in the worst possible way imaginable."
Lies
"USA is the most corrupt country in the world yes Haiti is a poor country but we are honest poor countries, there are countries that only prevent poor countries from developing, countries like USA are only profiting from poor countries in order to keep their place of great power"
Burn Chochonet you mean like giving Iraq and Afghanistan millions of dollars a year for help with recovery? That's how we keep them poor right? You are not honest poor you are corrupt poor. Don't blame us for your problems. Blame the Clintons.
Of course Haitian people hate the clintons I mean look at with the clintons did to Haiti it's absolutely disgusting what they did to these people makes me freaking sick

"Republican Rep. Mia Love condemned President Donald Trump on Thursday over his reported comments referring to immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti and some African nations as coming from â€œshithole countries.â€ùThe Utah representative, whose family is from Haiti, called on the president to apologize and said his remarks were â€œunkindâ€ù and â€œdivisive.â€ùâ€œThe Presidentâ€™ comments are unkind, divisive, elitist, and fly in the face of our nationâ€™s values. This behavior is unacceptable from the leader of our nation. My parents came from one of those countries but proudly took an oath of allegiance to the United States and took on the responsibilities of everything that being a citizen comes with,â€ù Love said in a statement on Thursday."
NEVER!!!!!
John Borowski and who cares what Mia Love thinks. Haiti is one of the most impoverished corrupt nations. Why do we need to only have people from impoverished nations come here. Why not immigrants from other countries who are educated want to be Americans and Work. Also where is her outrage over the millions of dollars the Clintons never gave to Haiti or its people ?  That should upset her more. If it doesnâ€™t neither she nor her parents care about Haiti either. She is a congresswoman. Let her down something about that.
HAHA HAHAHA
"Yep it's true, he's a man of his word, so the hateful democrats have to fall apart over any little thing he says."
#RussianBot
If Mia Love is from Haiti she already knows its a shithole.
Demi Mitsos Educated people from say (Norway like the president mentioned) don't want to come here.
"They do not need to leave Norway is nice. They will have a crash of their economy within the decade, but it is nice now."
"Saven, a MAN of the world?! More like an irreverant child in the world at best! Wake up Americans! Dump Trump!!!"
"Cristal Rauert so you are an ""economic expert"" on Norway?  HAHAHAHAHA."
"Why yes, Masters (Economics, Business and Accounting). Would you like salt and pepper with the foot you just placed in your mouth Einstein?"
Future expectation; stemming from historical data... doh!_Ÿ˜‚
Sandy? Still eating crow?
You meant #MakeAmericaRacistAgain
"BEST President Donald J. Trump IN USA HISTORY WE LOVE HIM.... President Donald J. Trump Please talk a bit about HAITI WHERE WERE THE OUT CRIES FROM HYPOCRITE DEMONRATS? this MAKES HILLIARS SKIN CRAWL WHEN WE SENT DONATIONS HILLIAR clinton CASH STOLE poor Haiti money BECAUSE CHELSEA needed it more for her WEDDING.. and they still living in tents s***hole clintons PLEASE President Donald J. Trump TELL DEMONRATS ABOUT THEIR CROOKS CLINTONS AND HAITI!!Jul 18, 2016 - In January 2015 a group of Haitians surrounded the New York offices of the Clinton Foundation. They chanted slogans, accusing Bill and Hillary Clinton of having robbed them of â€œbillions of dollars.â€ù Two months later, the Haitians were at it again, accusing the Clintons of duplicity, malfeasance, and theft."
Man of his word--give me a break!!!  This man would not know honesty if it came up and bit him in the a__!!!  What a total and complete failure we have as a President---
"Yes, Barbara, Obama was the biggest con ever placed on the States!"
Lmao they are shitholes lol tell it like it is !!
We need more of him esp in Australia
Sandy Daniel and you know that because? Try any European nation. For the last 50 years it has been an influx of people from impoverished nations. Why not vary it? All of the countries in Europe that were once held under the fist of communism? We just have open borders. The president is right. His comment might have been harsh but it sure rings true. I am tired of my taxes supporting the impoverished from other nations. We need a better balance.
Sure people from Norway would never want to come here my brother married a Norwegian and he decided to stay in Norway because she didn't remotely want to come to this country she seen what this president has done and she doesn't want to be thought of as a bigot too
Well said
"Barbara Zobairi I think you need to go back and see how many lies that has been told by Bill and Hillery Clinton ,hussien obama (the muslim ) both of the bushes and many more we could go into detail about how wonderful they have been but it would take to long to tell all of their lies go and look up the real history on them ."
"Not me, foreign bot, not me"
Saven Mi- you can't be this delusional _Ÿ˜ê

Steve Estrada You mean little things like falsely accusing an American President of treason?
"How do you distinguish his ""word"" from his serial lying?"
"Demi Mitsos, do you think we are inviting emigrants from impoverished countries to come here and denying entry for emigrants from first world, European nations? Because that is entirely false. We can't force people from what you deem to be good countries or worthy countries to move here. People from impoverished countries want to come here because they want to build a better life. Which, unless you are Native, is why your ancestors came here, too. ""Why not vary it?"" Seriously? Re-examine your thinking on that one."
ME!
"These other countries need to help thier people rebuild it. Impoverished countries people cant all move here. We simply can't support the whole world just like we cant expect other countries to do that for us either. We need to help our own homeless unemployed disabled and veterans get back on thier feet. Thats not saying not to help others, just not in that way."
I disagree about making America great.  My experience in traveling parts of the world.  Nothing but negative comments about Americans.    Donald Trump's is causing people in other countries to hate Americans more.      It was said to hear Americans being trashed.
Canadians were more liked.
"If you are willing to risk your life on a raft made of inner tubes and barrels, across the Caribbean or Mediterranean Seas to escape a rotten Government, you might be from a sh*t-hole."
and if you make comments like this you might be a shithole.

And isn't that why most of our ancestors came here.....
President Donald J Trump! Thank you for the sacrifices you're making and all the slander and lible against you. We know how deceitful the media is. We stand with you in thought and prayers.
"Sacrifices? Yes, spending 1/4 of last year playing golf and making sure he passes laws that benefit himself. You are funny."

IDIOT!
Totally Agree.

"Daniel Divananda A person who makes a comment about our president is not a troll. If making comments makes you a troll, trump is troll in chief."
What sacrifice is he making?
"I have been to US and Europe I saw shanty houses and your people sh**t on the wall and streets when they get drunk.Did you know that  how Haitians have ended up there...??? island...???Thses S***hole countries are devoted Christian and pray to Jesus whether they have accept the religion by force or through missionaries all of them have lost their mothertoung language.@!"
"Sharon Germain Trump is a patriot, and people against the country from sh!thole countries need to fix their countries."
"Sacritices ?  Are you people nuts? He just let that German Bank off the hook. You know, the one he launders his money through as Bannon told us. Wake up dummies, he ain't no 2nd coming."
ROFLMO  the man who had names for everyone who challenged him and lies constantly cwying about liable and slander against him now that is precious and proves he is the snowflake in chief and you are nothing more than a blind follower so wrapped up in your own self-pity you cannot see you are voting against your own best interests.
"Yes, Haiti is a s..... People gave their money in GOOD FAITH BILLIIONS and the Clinton Foundation stole it, They could have had new schools, new homes, new hospital for the whole island, THATS WHAT HE MEANS and most men lives revolves around,,,,,, like them on CNN,â™¥ï¸è"

"Thank you President Trump, for speaking the truth. To hell with political correctness."
Yes thank you for your sacrifices.... which are:______
I donâ€™t think you know what those words mean.
"You'll also be out of USA if you're not already, that is if he has his way,  therefore stop patronising him."

"to all you sick liberal paid trolls.....please read the entire post.  It explains what the communist/socialist/ dems demand.Alinskyâ€™s 12 Rules for bringing about a Solcialist dictatorship.  this is what  Hillery wrote for  her college thesis on and why she calles herself a ""progressive""  this is what the NWO demands and what the Communist dems aka liberals want1. â€œPower is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.â€œ Power is derived from 2 main sources â€“ money and people. â€œHave-Notsâ€ù must build power from flesh and blood.2. â€œNever go outside the expertise of your people.â€œ It results in confusion, fear and retreat. Feeling secure adds to the backbone of anyone.3. â€œWhenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy.â€œ Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty.4. â€œMake the enemy live up to its own book of rules.â€œ If the rule is that every letter gets a reply, send 30,000 letters. You can kill them with this because no one can possibly obey all of their own rules.5. â€œRidicule is manâ€™s most potent weapon.â€œ There is no defense. Itâ€™s irrational. Itâ€™s infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions.6. â€œA good tactic is one your people enjoy.â€œ Theyâ€™ll keep doing it without urging and come back to do more. Theyâ€™re doing their thing, and will even suggest better ones.7. â€œA tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.â€œ Donâ€™t become old news.8. â€œKeep the pressure on. Never let up.â€œ Keep trying new things to keep the opposition off balance. As the opposition masters one approach, hit them from the flank with something new.9. â€œThe threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.â€œ Imagination and ego can dream up many more consequences than any activist.10. â€œIf you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a positive.â€œ Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public sympathizes with the underdog.11. â€œThe price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.â€œ Never let the enemy score points because youâ€™re caught without a solution to the problem.12. â€œPick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.â€œ Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions."
How dare the corrupt media use his own words against him! He never contradicts his own policies during televised meetings and never ever plays golf! #PRESIDENTSH$THOLE
"Because we exploit their natural resources and take advantage of the land, buy their governments, and infect their way of live."
"Elsie Austin Shorty He gave up his life as a billionaire to accept this job (taking no salary) to listen to the lies, mocking, rude comments about his family because he sees America is going down the tubes.

Totally Agree.
I love they butthurt people on here. Yep. Heâ€™s still our President. _Ÿ™Œ_Ÿè__Ÿ™Œ_Ÿè__Ÿ˜˜
"To be fair, one sacrifice Trump has made is spending only about 100 days playing golf during his first year as president. Letâ€™s face it, that left well over 250 additional days without playing golf. Thatâ€™s not easy to live with. However, Trump was able to endure that â€œsacrificeâ€ù because he didnâ€™t have to pay for it. American tax payers paid tens of millions of dollars to safely secure Trumpâ€™s private golf course escapades so that Trump could spend almost one-third of his first year as president playing golf and eating gourmet cheeseburgers which actually put money in his pocket.#TrumpWelfare"
"Willie Williamson link that. do you know him?  have you witnessed any?  or are you just an old, leathery socialist wannabe because you didn't make good life choices?"
Ask yourself what did the Clintons do for the Haitians! They kept the donations that were supposed to help the Haitian people! The truth is we cannot save the world but it is important to save our country! There's a lot of our people that's poor enough already we don't need for them to be poorer! Hollywood elitist they have enough money for them to live in luxury they not worried about being poor so they can sit up on their pedestals and preach to everybody about what they should do and shouldn't do but they have no idea as to what it's like to be poor and furthermore they don't care they're just in a clique and they want to push their agenda! Yes I agree president Trump should not have used the word s*** hole but we can't take everybody in there's just no way without taking away from our poor people. People like Dick Durbin are killing Illinois making it a sanctuary state. Our state is so far in debt now it's never going to get out they've raised taxes people are moving... Chicago's a total mess ....and the Liberals think they can push this immigration agenda that is for open borders America will not survive that.
Peter A. Gonzalez you do remember obama and his outings or is your memory fading? hypocrite.
"Well we know OUR President is doing great things! How else can you explain Dems being so vicious in their efforts to attacks to discredit him ?? Useing false,misleading statements and vulgar language"
Beth Huth a very good description of the clinton foundation and clinton global initiatives and their destruction of Haiti.

"You are so funny! So sacrificing to you means spending more time on paid vacations than any other president, on our tax dime, passing laws that directly benefit him and his family, spending hours each day watching tv and tweeting?!

"Suzie Duchene Why are you so brainwashed. All the reports, ven from his own people confirm this. You are really a sad sad person to deny what is so blatently the truth. So even as pics of Trump show him on the golf course for 100 days you are calling those fake? Really? What does it take for you to ""get it""?"
Jason T. Chambers Amen? Sacrifice?
"Julie Sherman. First of all President Trump is not taking a paycheck the golf course he own so that cost nothing.watching hr of tv that's a joke.you need to stop listening to fake news.so you would love to have murders Muslim HUSSEIN Obama and Clintons that murder American ambassador and Navy Seals .the bodies count are just add up with the Clintons. they gave free passes to Muslims terrorists,illegals murders, rapest, drug dealers .now we got to pay Obama mother in law 150 thousands for doing thing.so BRAIN DEAD SNOWFLAKES get your head out of you butt ._Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸PRESIDENT TRUMP_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸is for the TRUE AMERICANS.and we TRUE AMERICANS stick together..._Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸âù__Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸"
Patty Mayer Do u have proof of that  I'm giving him time  and so far hes proving good by all the accomplishments so far.
Trump is also working for free.  Not taking the presidential pay.  More time is needed  A year isn't very long.
Carolyn Swann Swanson the tax plan he just passed will save him between 800 Million to over a Billion dollars personally. Last time I checked 800 Million is greater than 400 thousand.....The abuse and slander he spews against anyone he perceives is against him is embarrassing to our nation.
Bradley Reagan Trump criticized President Obama regularly for playing golf. The fact he has played golf 3x as much is hypocrisy of the highest order. The fact he goes to his own private resorts and charges the US taxpayers. He personally has made millions of dollars from this practice.
Adrian Lewis name the false and misleading statements? When his words are accurately reported and he screams fake news....just because you donâ€™t like the truth does not make it fake.
Vl Marsland all of those marks were already at record levels when he took office.
Suzie Duchene what is unfounded?
Patty Mayer I agree completely. Our President is a con man.
"Marlene Sudnick the presidential salary is 400k, his Golf trips cost the nation more than that daily. The tax laws he just passed will make him and his family a Billion dollars."
Trump tells the truth and only fools cant handle the truth!!!!
Jason T. Chambers yes
Jason T. Chambers yes
Jason T. Chambers he donates his fckn salary and yes he was a billionaire before he became our POTUS
Patty Mayer The politicians could stop all the goods coming in from China any time they wanted to. Too many wealthy people make money by brokering deals with Chinese manufactures.
Patty Mayer People like Donald Trump have suggested placing an import tax on China to level the playing field.
"whatever took place, whatever was said, you sir give people the courage to speak truth . Courage to stand up against PC nonsense. Thank you for that"
#fuckeveryonetodeath
This isn't pc nonsense. So you're legitimizing hatred of people of a particular racial or ethnic background?
"Joel, Go cry to mommy, snowflake.  We are used to being called racists for no reason from fascist libturds like yourself."
Not even an American.
Joel Fogelsanger wht are you twisting the words? He wasn't talking about the people and you know it.
A Ron Heindrix you first pal
"He was talking about people. If he looked at your house and called it a sh*thole,  how would you feel?  Would you still love him then?"
"Joe Matt,  you're called racists because that's what you are. You're showing how unpatriotic you are and opposed to American ideals that we hold dear. Why don't you all have a rally and spit on the Statue of Liberty?"
Joel Fogelsanger listen we call Chicago and Baltimore shithole to .get over it.
Shame on you.
"Donald Trump is not welcomed in Africa.....BOYCOTT America, China now Number 1 in World leadership....Keep your stupid president and good luck with trade deals with rest of world...Trump is an A-hole"
"Joel, the problem is we have fundamentally different understandings of American ideals. You want to give away the farm, bub. what those countries need are high skilled immigrants. Pack your bags. I'll buy you a one way ticket to utopia."
Joel Fogelsanger    It is PC nonsense. Those particular countries were accurately described....and it is fault of their tyrannical governments.
Brandon is butthurt.  Another melting snowflake!   Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
"No he wasn't talking about the people.  He was talking about the government that lines their pockets and don't take care of the people but you keep twisting the truth.  You should apply for a job at CNN. If someone called my house a name and it was the truth no I wouldn't get mad. The truth will stand when the world's on fire."
"Joel Fogelsanger, your hyperbole is boring.  You are the only bigot here as you lash out against those that hold differing views and call then names.  The statue of liberty and its poem is nothing but a crutch and lame argument for those that can't defend their stance.  The poem that was written on that statue was for deeds we had already done.  What we were being praised for.  Not some law or creedo. Why do you guys want unfettered, untraceable, and unlimited immigration.  I'll tell you why your party does.  Cheap labor and cheap votes.  You guys are exploiting vulnerable people for wealth add political power.  All of your virtue signaling behind immigration reform is to hide your true actions.  Democrats will have their plantations no matter what."
Steven Parker you are next _Ÿ™‚
Hereâ€™s some truth.  Youâ€™re from Canada and your opinion does not matter.
"Joel Fogelsanger The New Colossus"" is a sonnet that American poet Emma Lazarus (1849â€“1887) wrote in 1883 to raise money for the construction of the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty.[2] In 1903, the poem was engraved on a bronze plaque and mounted inside the pedestal's lower level. It has no association with the U.S. Constitution."
"Jamie, it's not a matter of "" whatever he said"", Trump DID say it. Wake up Americans! DUMP TRUMP!!!"
"â€œWhy do we want all these people from Africa here? Theyâ€™re shithole countries ... We should have more people from Norway.â€ù (Reuters: http://reut.rs/2DotWiv). Down with PC crap like this snowflake nonsense: ""But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind. And you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you, for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.â€ù (Luke 14:13-14). Or this: ""Give me your tired, your poor / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.â€ù Instead, let's re-write the Statute of Liberty to say: Feast at our table if you come from riches. Otherwise, stay in your shithole! MAGA! Courage to say it like it is!"
"Steve Parker, WOW you took the words right out of my mouth and I know of several others who need to step in line right behind him.  THANK YOU!"
I suppose when he said Obama wiretapped him it was the truth?
"And even if you called it a ""sh**hole,"" well, that would be accurate.  Remember that Haiti relied upon funds from the Clinton foundation after their devastating loss...and got nothing."
"Yep, Clinton promised new road infrastructure & business opportunities, hospitals & schools.  He took care of his cronies & robbed the Haitian citizens."
LOL  oh the Clintons oh no what are we going to do.  ROFLMAO
but given Trump's constantly lying the world is looking at the USA as a shithole filled with dumb dolts.
I much rather want someone to lie and tell me how much they love haiti and then steal money from them behind their backs. That's how politicians are supposed to do this.
"Jim Honeck He doesn't lie.  The media does.  Try turning off CNN for about 5 minutes, you might learn something."
"I supported operations in many countries, and for one would agree. Calling a country something is not like saying that about someone. Many use the term, and simply means that we wont risk the CHAOS of said country."
Wether or not a country is a shithole is not relevant. The. President. Should. Not. Say. That.
"SHITHOLE ....IS  MILD COMPARED TO WHAT IT REALLY IS...  A CORRUPT, GREEDY, INSENSITIVE GOVERNMENT THAT ONLY LINES IT'S OWN POCKETS...."
This is a troll people! There are not just many people arguing on behalf of Donald Trump! Be aware this is not a real page

"The shithole wasn't Haiti, it was in the Obama administration"
"Why would Democrats supporters media ,DemocRATS be mad on what he said(if that is true) about any country ? It's true anyway....why make a big deal about it....."
All hypocrites....
"Is the clinton foundation an elected official in haiti? the Clinton foundation has no power to implement anything without the government say so. the money was most likely directed to their non poor areas, kinda like how in the US we ignore poverty and homelessness. yeah they focus on those doing well. the us is just a wealthier version of haiti.  it will take some time before we hit that.  now when clinton was president and they were against haiti raising their minimum wage to $5 a day, because businesses needed the cheap labor. and businesses left after it was raised."
Shelly Boggs Harvey Yep...what they got were hotels built for the rich and a cellphone scam.
"REMEMBER KYLE, THE LITTLE PEOPLE ARE NOT APT AT THE TRUTH."
"WE WERE AWARE WHEN VOTING AND ELECTING PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT HE WAS A LEADER THAT SAYS WHAT HE MEANS AND MEANS WHAT HE SAYS,  HE IS THE FIRST PRESIDENT WHO WILL LOOK FRIEND OR FOE IN THE EYE AND TELL UM LIKE IT IS ''THE TRUTH'', HIS SUPPORTERS LOVE IT, HIS ENEMIES AND DETRACTORS FEAR IT, VOTE PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR 2020 AND GIFT HIM THE SEATS OF HIS OPPONENTS IN 2018 AND 2020."
Maybe if the Clinton Mafia hadn't stole their $$$ the country would be in better shape.  :)
"Kyke, it isn't a matter of IF Trump made the "" shithole"" remark. He DID make that remark!!! Unstable imbecile!!!"
I know. Totally _Ÿ_¢ yuck!!

Oh but they got a lot of cell phones that the clintons made Millions off of and it didn't rebuild any of their homes

"If anyone hates the blacks,  knowing that he also hates Jesus because Jesus was born in Israel and learned that an Israelite is a black people."

The makes two if your black ....your not helping whites.......
*you're
To what end?   This is a discussion about Trump's behaviour so it's completely irrelevant.
Yeah Sweet  thanks a lot
Seriously? Haiti has a warrant out for Hillarys arrest.
And you know this because.........??
Niro Martinez - SHOW ME
Dino Vescino - You seriously asking this question when it's been known since 1998?  SMH
The Haitians never received any money. What a joke the clintons are.
Who gives a crap if he said a curse word.  These politicians are not angels. Neither are we.  Get over it and get on with what they were doing.
Good point Ben
Ben Sprouse why do I have to show you? Scroll through Trumps tweets. Better to hear it from the POTUS than Me.
"John Arsenault, ""completely irrelevant"" only because you don't want to hear about it."
"Niro Martinez,  Thats funny even Haiti wants to LOCK HER UP ? LOL .. according to Global research the Clinton Foundation stole $2 Billion SHE SHOULDN'T STOLE THEIR DISASTER FUNDS  EARTHQUAKE  MONEY !!  _Ÿ˜¢"

because the clintons took the money that was should have went to haitlians people to rebuild there homes and now the live in a shithole because of the clintons themoney went to the clinton foundation and paid for there daughter wedding. that right i called it a shithole because of the clintons  cause it is a shithole
They build 6 homes.
Perhaps Haiti would have better standing if the Clintons would turn lose of all that money they raised for them.....
stop blaming the Clinton's ..this is all trump . Haiti had an Earthquake in 2010 with a magnitude of 7.0 off the charts .an lol whats soo funny is most of the that money whent too aid an Clinton Foundation never left there .they are still helping an few others like City team min... foundation of hope get facts
Fake News....but keep saying it.....it might come true.
DECEITFUL
"Sharon Bachman Scott Clinton, Omama and all the $. Cannot help that shitehole. Get real."
"Sharon Bachman Scott tell that to Haitians.  They have a different story.  But hey, you know better."
They can't. They spent it all on Chelsea.
Good idea to record the meetings!
Exactly LaVonda!
Sharon Bachman Scott keep telling yourself that.
"Sharon Bachman Scott Haiti has always been a s***hole. I have been there and was happy to get back to the Dominican side which is only slightly less of a s***hole. Even if Trump said that he would only be guilty of being bluntly truthful. Haitians cross over to the Dominican Republic to work in the sugar cane fields for $3 per day. NO, the Clintons have done ZERO to improve the lives in Haiti. Go there and you will still find Tent Villages everywhere."
Trying to divert.....who is the president NOW
YOU CLOWNS ARE SO STUPID THIS IS NOW WORLD NEWS AND THE WORLD HAVE NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT THE CLINTONS BUT ITS TRUMP..THE BEST QUOTE TODAY CAME FROM GHANA SAYING THE PRESIDENT OF THE US IS THE REAL SHITHOLE
Where do think the Clintons got so rich? Civil servants salary? Gangsters
Sharon Bachman Scott donâ€™t melt down snow flake!
Jim Hayden exactly!
Sharon Bachman Scott You are CRAZY Proven fact the Clintons stole the money donated to them
Loose.
You mean all that money they stole from them.

Bill why so focused on the clintons
Sharon Bachman Scott spell much?
"right here in black and white.  Andy Miller The Clinton familyâ€™s charitable work in Haiti has been a mix of success, disappointment and controversy. As our Washington Post colleagues reported, some Clinton-backed projects didnâ€™t come through, such as a $2 million housing expo for thousands of new housing units. The Government Accountability Office found poor planning and unsustainable outcomes for taxpayer-funded projects through USAID, such as a $170 million power plant and port for the Caracol Industrial Park, which the Clinton Foundation promoted.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/06/13/did-the-clinton-foundation-raise-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-for-a-hospital-in-haiti-that-was-never-built/?utm_term=.86c78458b85c"

You don't hear the news media talking about how the Clinton's stole from them.
Hillary stole the China from the White House after Bill left that's what kind of people the clintons are
"Kathrina Wilhelm Why don't you actually look at the Clinton Foundation's site online. All of their tax documents are there. It is an A+ rated charity. Look at the source, not just stories."
loose
I think the Clintons spent it on Chelseas wedding...
"But, but, but...THE CLINTONS!!!"
they took in tons of cash for aids then bought cheep substandard drugs to give those people saying who cares about a bunch of africans and blacks
"The Pinocchio TestThereâ€™s a lot of criticism lodged against the Clintons for their involvement with recovery efforts in Haiti. But Cohenâ€™s claim that Hillary Clinton raised hundreds of millions of dollars through the Clinton Foundation for a hospital that was never delivered is not credible.There is, indeed, a major public hospital in Port-au-Prince that has been delayed, even though it was one of the first projects approved by the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission. The commission was co-chaired by Bill Clinton, who became the face of many recovery efforts in Haiti. Cohen can blame Bill Clintonâ€™s leadership on the commission, or the managing of taxpayer money for this project. But that claim is entirely different from the one Cohen made. Perhaps Cohen was referring to the $500 million in â€œcommitments to actionâ€ù for Haiti initiatives announced by the Clinton Foundation. But not all of the commitments were relating to health care or building a hospital, and the commitments donâ€™t involve Clinton Foundation money.Weâ€™ve done our part to check out his claim, but the burden of proof still lies with Cohen. If he wants to respond and point us to a specific source, weâ€™re eager to take a look. In the meantime, he earns Four Pinocchios.Four Pinocchios"
And stole!
"Cameron Mitchell Trump Hater, shut up and stay in Canada your socialist country!_Ÿ‘_"
Yeah - they spent it on Chelseaâ€™s 3 million dollar wedding and her $1000 haircuts and color.  She was a politician and a public servant not a business owner.  Where did they get their dough?  Think and research before blindly believing....
"Dave Condit that is right, clintons, clintons, clintons!!!!!"
Dave Condit are you refering that you defend the clintons right to keep that money promised for Haiti???
Prove it!

And DFT does? Your an IDIOT
"Brandon Brosvik, what proof do you have of this?  NBC news?  Lmfao  show proof fool"
if the Dems are so concerned with Haiti perhaps they should force the Clintons to pay what they stole from them!!!! _Ÿ˜è
"Us ""idiots"" say that because it's been documented that the Clintons intercepted aid that was intended for Haiti and kept it for themselves."
Kat keep spreading the truth
There is an investigation going on of the Clinton Foundation....hopefully this will come out. Similar to Hillary paying for the fake Russian Dossier...she is a criminal to the core.
Philip Fair Really? Maybe you better check on that.
The Clinton Foundation raised over 9 billion for the earthquake in Haiti... 600 million went to Haiti... that leaves 8.4 billion collected for Haiti that never got there... maybe that why the allegations are still there... really sounds like more than unproven allegations
"Philip Fair has clearly never been to Haiti. Or seen any documentaries on Haiti that show no relief on the ground from the Clinton foundation, the Haitian gov, or the red cross really. There are tons of private organizations and non profits working without the foreign aid doing most of the work. In an environment that clearly hasn't seen many millions in help much less billions. What has been put in place by the Clintons is a mine for Hillary's brother. I'm sure thasts trickle down economics though."
Philip Fair Mr. Fair how would you know that they didn't steal from the Haitians?  The Haitians sure think they did.
"New Filing Shows Eric Trump Raised Millions, Lied About His Foundation's Expenses"

"Mike M Mills 9.5 billion??? Uhhh, probably not."
"Mr. Trump, none of your voters listen to Democrats, I doubt they're bothered by your language anyway. You were NOT voted as a politician, you were voted in because you WERE a normal guy just like everyone else. You're not pc, your words are not pretty, they're very blunt, and that's what we love about you. Now stop worrying about it and keep making this country great again! :)"
Normal? Ha!
Yea a conman ripping people off and acting like a fool on twitter isnâ€™t Norma lol
"If he is normal, I wonder what you are?  SHITHOLE PRESIDENT!"
"WHY give your enemy words THEY will use as weapons against you? I think many places outside the USA ARE sh*tholes, not just Haiti, El Salvidor or parts of Africa!! ... but TELLING THE TRUTH is too much for most people to handle. LOL-- They are NOT used to it, lol."
Correct.
Good right on
Trump is not a normal guy. He was born rich and never wanted for anything in his life. He does not know what it is like to be a normal working man or woman who lives from paycheck to paycheck. You people are being conned.
Normal like Norman Bates! Psycho is what he is and his supporters!!!
My favorite response yet. I agree completely Karl!
"Yes I am so glad we have a normal down to earth guy as President who grew up wealthy, went to Ivy League schools and became even richer as an adult. He knows the struggles of the Middle and Working Class. _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚"
So TRUE! MAGA!
Very true _Ÿ‘ç
Hooray!
"Well, compared to your average politician he is. That's why he stands out like a sore thumb. ;)"
wrong
Mike Torres wrong
Bonnie Louise VandenBerg wrong
Love you comment Mr. Brown.  I believe President Trumps supporters feel the same.  It's just hard listening to the BS.
Let the lies begin.  Maybe we have it all wrong t rumples.  Maybe the actual problem is a multi personality disorder.  Who are you today?  Guess we'll see.
Loser
Smoke another bowl and let the grown folks run this country...
at least he doesn't have a disease called the left and PC.
So youâ€™re finally admitting the afflictions of the dem party.
Haitiâ€™s gift to America was AIDS. Maybe you should thank that Shithole _Ÿ™„
Keep pouting_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ_£
"Laura let me get this straight. You think what he said was over the top, uncalled for etc. What about the things people have said about trump and his family as well as your fellow citizens that support him and you just called him a name or implied he has multiple personalities but that is okay with you. You do realize you just made your statements null and void cuz you can't complain about him and then turn around and do the same thing."
Laurie...our President will always keep his supporters....stop making yourself look ignorant...lol. _Ÿç__Ÿ˜©
"Laurie, you are too stupid to breathe!"
"Maybe he has a ""cold""...heh heh heh...no, more likely, DEMS took his words and twisted them...like they ALWAYS do."
Please Laurie get real
What exactly are your mental health credentials? A high school diploma doesnâ€™t cut it..
"Well, I'm me. I know I'm a man and not some made up freakazoid gender. That's already two for two against you libtards. Anything else?"
"Which one are you from?  California,  colorado, oregon, or washington. Let's see. It's usually pretty easy to spot people from those 4 states."
Ohh look another fake doctor handing out a fake diagnosis.
Pffft.. you think you are just so intelligent I bet? That's the way females on the left appear to me. But there appears to be a lack of Common Sense
What about Hillary Clinton calling Americans deplorables and other offensive phases? I hope you are consistent with your criticism of Trump and hold others to the same high standards.
Lay off that weed. Legal or not itâ€™s turning your brain into mush.
"Maybe you have it all wrong. Maybe if the Clintons put the money their foundation raised into that country, maybe it wouldnâ€™t be so bad that theyâ€™d flea on rafts made out of garbage."
"Trolling liberal! Check the Facebook page"
So what is your diagnosis of the Clinton's grabbing Haiti by the sh**hole lady?
Keep trying lmao epic fail
"Lmfao. The one with the mental narcissistic brain left last January. You know, the most crooked and corrupt president we ever had, Odumma. All facts."
You can believe he won't be Hillary..... Cause he's a winner !!! Hahahaha !! Loose much _Ÿ˜‚
The lie is that he said it.

"He calls them like he sees them! A shithole is a shithole! No matter how much you little liberal heart bleeds for savages that hate your guts, and want you dead!"
Hey MORON!! Haiti is a SHITHOLE! Get over your ignorant self......
The reality is painful for sensitive ears. The description of shitholes is accurate for many of these countries.
Looks like you have a bigger problem.... nothing but freakin' lies from the left.... go away!  What he said was true..... reality .... not a liberal belief..... La La Land and Make Believe is all you know... dumb is one thing...... glorifying it is insane.... liberals seem to be both!!!
Haha oh the irony. Liberals talking about other people having mental disorders.
We have our own shitholes in America- called democrat run cities. Go to Chicago- total shithole!
Go help then!
I put the blood of Jesus on AMERICA!
David Clark that always makes me laugh too. Crazy people calling sane people crazy...lol
trusting in an unknown source is how obama killed 87 people in a wedding party with a drone.... But that is not a problem for you as long as he uses nice words.
Maybe you shouldnt diagnose anybody
Another fake psychologist diagnosing mental illness! Lol
"Well, obummer had a great polished personality. He loved being on tv shows, but was real bad for our country. Popularity was more important to him than our country was"
"Put your your pink hat on honey, your brain isn't functional."
And Diane Feinstein had a cold which made her mentally incapable.  _Ÿ˜‚.  Haiti is a _Ÿ’© hole.
"Laurie, on target explanation."
"So you have an issue with Trump calling Haiti a sh*thole so much you self diagnosed him to have split personalities, yet you say nothing about the fact that Hillary stole about 90% of Hatians relief funds and created the sh*thole it is today."
That's actually called dissociative personality disorder and it doesn't even exist
Maybe it would not be a shithole if Clinton had sent the money they raised
The truth hurts
Put the gin bottle away lady...get over it you lost..hahahha
Leave

"Bless you anyway, Laurie. It has already been declared in the Heavens that our President Trump will not only thrive, but be a two-term President. Now, this is from a person, me, who did not vote for EITHER candidate! But I have come to love and pray for this man. No one is perfect, and I pray for you too. Love to you!"
HAHAHAHAHA MAGA!
"Maybe, but... maybe you're just a moron!"
"Mallea Johnson partially true but Haiti along with alot of countries in Africa and almost every where the government maintain their ppl in extreme poverty for ages. Come to present day President Trump has said and maintains that U.S. money will no longer go to countries where we do not benefit. The don't believe the Haitian government would allow relief organizations to go into the country and create ways the ppl could help themselves. Like drilling for water, farming and if so the government would keep it for themselves....extremely corrupt. Like Cuba, Mexico and many more."
Looks like you are not too educated and it shows.
I see you don't have any common sense....stupidly rules.
--Laurie Adams-- I'll bet there's not one democrat in state or federal government that has planned their vacation at the best resort in Haiti......
"He's YOUR president, Laurie Adams. YOUR president. Doesn't it feel good?"

"If he said it,well he did it is true, the ones who leaked are dems,so do they think that is going to get them a deal.Look we the people don,t want a sham immigration bill."
No our problem is armchair online faux-psychologists... Idiot!
"Dems are trying to blackmail to get DACA deal,we don't want it,We the People want a wall ,we want a real immigration bill, not an open Amnesty bill for illegals. The people see what the Dems are doing,how they could care less what the American people want,we want our country protected."
Maybe if the Clinton's hadn't stolen the money they collected in donations for Haiti it might be a somewhat better place to live!

Another Libtarded Snowflake whiney baby.
Remember the Clinton Foundation took in millions of dollars to help rebuild Haiti after their earthquake and never did.  Any fault that Haiti is a shithole sits squarely with the Clintons!  Never powder puff the truth Mr. President.  Your base stands behind you and I believe it is growing!
GO TRUMP!!!
but what about is all you got to defend a man that isn't qualified to be President..
Lee Powell he is qualified to be President. He proves it everyday
"Yes they did. The Clinton's are murderers of poor innocent Haitians, when they promised the people funding from the Clinton Foundation and didn't get the funding. Where is the outrage there!!! Smdfh"
Yep. I remember the Clinton's took lots of $ to rebuild. Wasn't it over 400 million.
So that makes trump okay?
"Lee Powell.  Anyone can be president.  All they have to do is file, run and win."
"No, it doesn't make it ok, but there is a double standard. Yes,  he needs to quiet himself at times, but it seems to be ok that the Dems can do immoral, unethical, egregious things and get away with everything. There is more to this conversation that took place and you can thank the media for not reporting the truth and facts."
Haiti is poor as it is today because the Clintons stole from the poor Haitians. The left even calls fellow Americans derogatory names. Hillary called about half of Americans deplorables!
The only thing growing is the girth around Trump's Mickey D stuffed middle.
Diane Embry she technically only called less than half deplorable. Because SHE WON THE POPULAR VOTE! And donnnnnnnnt you ferrgit it!!!
Patricia LaRue Merlin Monson you are dead wrong 401k..IRA's...Stock Market steady growing. Quit lying
Yeah and don't forget Hillary tried to walk out of Haiti with some small children. Guess they were gonna be pimped out
Patricia LaRue Merlin Monson If you take away the votes of dead people and illegals Trump won an even bigger victory than you losers will admit he did.
"I'm no particular fan of the Clintons but I'd like to see any of you Trump fanatics provide proof that they stole any relief money from the Haitians. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/19/mike-pence/pence-wrong-haiti-contracts-steered-clinton-friend/"
"Mary Titcomb, your 401k may be growing today.  But when the tax deform bill finally reached its full impact on your personal economy,  I'd love for you to be honest enough to admit you got screwed.  Which you did.  You just don't know it yet. Stocks? Don't make me laugh!  Average Americans don't play in the big gambling hall of wall street. Average Americans,  and I'm betting that includes you,  don't have the money to lose in gambles like that. The prices of commodities and goods is so far removed from the actual value,  it's meaningless to even connect that to anything related to the economy and average Americans. The idea that wall street means anything to anyone besides the rich is like the two stock brokers who survived a shipwreck.  They got stranded on a desert island.  To pass the time,  they traded the one hat between them.  By the time they were rescued,  the hat was worth $3 million!"
Patricia LaRue Merlin Monson please seek medical help!
Patricia LaRue Merlin Monson Next time the popular vote counts I will  think about it.
BUT HILLARY!!!!!
"The Truth, most people can't handle......the truth is sick."
"ARE you nuts?? Trump's base is just as IGNORANT AS him!!You just proved that!#"

They Are Money Hungry Fools. These People Have Money ADDICTION PROBLEMS.  REALITY.
Hillary and her cults
That's as lame of an excuse as the presidents
Remember how Clinton isnâ€™t president so it has nothing to do with this?
"Red Cross was in on that, too.  They collected millions and built 8 houses and left.  That's why Red Cross will never, ever get a penny from me."

I know it is growing!

"Caelidh Good Hatred is a â€œheartâ€ù sin, and any hateful thought or act is an act of murder in Godâ€™s eyes for which justice will be demanded, possibly not in this life but at the judgment. So heinous is the position of hate before God that a person who hates is said to be walking in darkness, as opposed to the light (1 John 2:9, 11). Hatred is a poison that destroys from within, producing bitterness that eats away at your heart and mind. This is why the Scriptures tell us not to let a â€œroot of bitternessâ€ù spring up in our hearts (Hebrews 12:15)."
"Caelidh Good Proof? None! He has worked from day one to bring us all together. One example his joint meeting with both Republicans and Dems in Congress.

Unnamed source? Lol. You mean like several of the congressman who were actually there and heard him say it? Both Republicans and Democrats who are speaking out today?
Every news source in the world has reported on this.  Are they all fake news?
"His name is Josh Dowsey and is a reporter for The Washington Post. Named source. Not to mention the number of credible Republicans and Democrats in the room with him. And the fact that Raj Shah, White House Press Secretary Deputy and token foreigner made a statment acknowledging his remarks."
Washington Post? LOL enough said
"Elizabeth Flynn , typical Trump supporter. You ignore every other comment on here naming sources. Republicans. Democrats. Even the deputy secretary. And you focus on the Washington Post. Yet people like you will gladly reference disreputable â€œnewsâ€ù sites like Breitbart. Thatâ€™s why no one takes you all seriously. Youâ€™re intentionally ignorant."
Elizabeth Flynn keep reading... about Raj Shah...
I don't really care what he allegedly said. I do care about what he has accomplished in one year. President Lyndon Johnson used much similar language and democrats and news media were not nearly as critical. Wonder why?  Could it be because he was a liberal democrat???
"Richard Baker, Lyndon Johnson was a LIBERAL democrat? In the sense of supporting the civil rights movement Iâ€™d say youâ€™re right, but letâ€™s just ignore that pesky little â€œVietnam Warâ€ù issue that he dragged us into. Iâ€™m not sure how liberal it is for someone to get us into a very unpopular war killing millions of indigenous people who posed no threat to us on the basis of a lie and then to force thousands of young men to fight and die under penalty of imprisonment if they refuse. But, if you were lucky, youâ€™d have been able to use daddyâ€™s influence to get out of serving your country by claiming â€œbone spurs,â€ù all while playing collegiate sports."
Ambassador for panama is resigning because of it you fcking knuckle dragger _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚
"Rob Lawrie i bet they all have worse foul mouths, obama cussed all the time, with the F word i read, hillary did all the time, to the secret service men and women, they said so, she treated people who worked with her and for her  like her slaves,some of them said they begged not to be assigned to her,  where was the congress and senators and news networks  then,"
"Richard Baker Hillary used worse treated those secret service men and women like their were her personal slaves, she called them ugly names , cussed at them, threaten them , they said they begged not to be given the assignment to have to work near her, obama they said used the F word and more in the White house , words worse than the shi- word, where was the people who run to tell what they said"
Allen Bell NOT TRUE--RESIGNATION WAS PREVIOUS--
"the alleged ""unnamed source"" wasn't even in the meeting, they claim to have been ""briefed"" on the meeting. Media can't stop lying!"
Doreen Rogers What about Raj Shah's statement on behalf of the White House where he didn't dispute the President's remarks? This has nothing to do with the media when his own staff isn't discrediting the statement. Open your eyes.
You're such an idiot! He did it to himself ...... AGAIN!
Trump supporters are pretty thick in general. Easily led. Like sheep _Ÿê‘ _Ÿ˜†
Doreen Rogers I'm still waiting for your response to Raj Shah's statement...
How do you keep defending this man?
Un-named? His 2 top Republican said he did!!
"Allen Bell if you stopped watching fake news  you would learn some true facts. So shut up and stay in your horrible Muslim run country_Ÿ‘_(From an exBrit)"
Allen Bell should start a crackfree life. You Libs/Dems are the largest sheep population ever.
"Yeah, i see a bunch of lost liberal sheep baa baa baa ing around!  No game, no substance. ..Just LOST  24/7!  GO TRUMP!  <3"
"Someone from Canada  posted ""if anyone KNOWS what causes liberalism please tell us! ""  OK!  Liberalism is a spiritual illness that was sowed by the mother.  Infants need specific care.  All babies are BORN WITH 5 specific cries.  1. hunger 2. pain. 3. tired 4. bored. 5. uncomfortable.   If these cries are not met with a loving, nursing, caring, knowledgeable mother in the first 3 yrs of childs life, your chances of sowing a liberal are  pretty high. 99%.  LGBTQP?  SAME!  It takes 3 yrs for our synaptic process to end in our brain.  Spirit to Love connection i call it.  Child uses both sides of brain!  Liberalism = stuck in left side of brain = lost!    Only 2 sides, People!  Shepherds and lost people!  Love our enemies?   Pray for them and care for the libs/lost sheep in your OWN family.  With God, and His Mother/Divine, Holy, Sacred Heart <3... all things are possible!  GO TRUMP!  <3 <3 <3"
"LOL.  ""Whenever Trump is having a good week""."
"It's not bad words that bother us, btw, it's using them to denigrate people."
"Carol Joy yes...GO TRUMP!!Go really fricking far away Trump!!!!!"
"Richard Baker, Lyndon Johnson was president like 50 years ago when it was liberal for women to wear slacks."
Richard Baker  Things were different. Nothing like that was ever reported by the media. Johnson lacked social graces. Kennedy and Johnson dragged the US into the Vietnam War.  His support declined as the war escalated and violence at home increased.
Some Tekula I guess.
I would record the meetings.  The problem is that left is just waiting for this these bits of National Enquirer type leaks and once one says it then it is truth in their minds.  Keep up the good work and ignore the silly behavior from the left.
Yea.... letâ€™s definitely have him record the meetings. As a trump hater I love this idea
Nixon and a few other presidents recorded everything.
So silly to think that the POTUS shouldn't refer to countries as shitholes...
It was a Republican who told what he said.
"Curtis Mello wow, Harvard has really lowered their standards. What a shithole"
Chris Allen owchie bit by a faceless troll my little snow flake heart is melllltinggggg I need praise and an award now _Ÿ˜_
Curtis Mello just like trump...not surprising. lol....
This was not a national enquirer leak. These are statements corroborated by Democrat and Republican witnesses. You are an idiot and donâ€™t understand the damage this behavior does.
"I think that President Trump doesn't despise the Hispanics, in fact, we Venezuelans are very grateful for his actions against the Maduro dictatorship and we hope that President Trump will put an end to this horrible communist dictatorshi"
"If he was HObama, his words wouldn't be leaked. These rat basTURDS want to unseat our President."
Like Wolff recorded the White House staffers so trump couldnâ€™t try to say heâ€™s lying?
"Yes, you said it best"
You should definitely record meetings and expect this to happen nonstop anyway.  They're never going to stop inventing faux outrage against any and all political adversaries to spread throughout their media propaganda arms.  It's just another day...deflecting from the real story which is an illegal FISA  surveillance warrant against a political rival.
"I think you should replay recordings at Sarah's meetings and once per day have her start each briefing with a board listing all of their ""re-interpretations"" and outright lies listed beside the facts, named by reporter and outlet.  Go through them one by one...then start allowing questions.  I would love to see it detailed each day exactly what they make up."
"He is already on tape showing what despicable things he says.  He has said he could shoot someone and not lose supporters.... he SAID THAT , there is PROOF.. And you want us to believe he is some saint? Give me a break!"
cover up the truth is oprahs campaign slogan i heard
"Caelidh Good No, I am not saying anyone is a saint....Not even BO, but that is the only way he has ever been reported.  Trump is just a guy who speaks honestly from years of NOT being a well trained politician protected by an adoring media to cover is missteps for him.  You're way to comfortable believing whatever the media spreads as the sum total of a person's character and not looking at the person as a whole.  Everyone says harsh or unpopular things at times...And none of us are immune to it.  I find it highly hypocritical that you stay stuck on a quote yet can't find a single thing right about what he is accomplishing or has accomplished in his lifetime.  You don't think I can't find equally disturbing quotes to dredge up from the ruling elites in the DNC??  Well, youre very naive if you think they haven't stepped on a few squeaky boards themselves...It's just that no one allows those to be publicized."
AND trust me...I can find some recorded tape of liberals that would make you rethink your loyalty...If you were indeed being honest about assessing people on the same standards equally.
"i didnt have sexual relations with that woman was on live tv, And how many ppl wanted him back in the white house? Im sure the pro women femanazis didnt have a problem with that scenario due to fact they are democrats still"
The FISA thing you refer to never happened! It is stuck in your head because you listen to the liar-in-chief and that's what he told you. A FACTUALLY PROVEN LIE.
Check again Shelley...not seeing it in liberal media echo chambers does not relegate it to rumor.  Look beyond your limited views of what's going on in this world.
"Actually FISA came from fox and friends, where trump gets all his info from _Ÿ_£"
"Sheri DeSimone yes politicians can be crass and hypoctical... But Trump is ignorant.  Just because he ""tells it like it is"" doesn't demonstrate good leadership, ethic, human values, etc.  If you talked like that at your job how do you think that would be received!??  I am sure most would be reprimanded.  We you always strive to be better people."
Great idea record everything and then let's see how he tries to lie his way out of everything he says.
"Matt Watson you want to talk about morals? Married 3 times, cheated on every one of them. Lies on average 5 times a day, bankrupt 6 times stiffs contractors his entire career. You and all of his supporters are number than a hake."
Chandler Pease Keep spreading liberal crap.  Yes 6 bankruptcies.  BUT he has over 500 companies.  So his bankruptcy rate is less than 2%.  far below the average.  But keep harping on the small part of the truth that fits your agenda!!!!
"And if I talked like Obama's, Hillary, Pelosi or schumer...I would be kicked out of work faster.  They all have lied and yet you think they're moral and worthy?  Sorry, but a billionaire with hundreds of companies and only 6 bankruptcies actually seems well below average....not to mention he worked for his billions rather than mysterious ""gifts"" and money laundering.  You're really not paying attention to details are you?  His ex wives haven't been treated poorly and rally around him...so the only one whining is -you."
"The REAL ""story "" is w/ Trump, there will be no happy ending for our country, Get him OUT!!!"
"Amazing. ...you had a regime weaponizing our own agency against citizens, spying on their adversaries illegally, supporting terrorism, dumping billions illegally to terrorist nations, lying routinely to pass damaging legislation, not enforcing our laws so we end up with this mess, selling state secrets in pay to play operations....and you think Trump is your biggest threat???  Still amazed at just how off their nuts liberals have become.  Smdh"
"No matter that we have the healthiest economy in a decade (that the Dems have to spin as doom and gloom lije gl9val warming predictions) tax money back in our pockets, regressive regulations reversed, states rights returned, border enforcement, ISIS defeated... because someone somewhere retold you a bad story about something that he did one time where he probably said something that was really mean ...and that's what you're basing your opinions on? Because Democratic leaders have never been mean, lied, or stood for something disgraceful?? Hypocrites on display.  Actions speak louder than words.  You should all be apologizing for not listening when we knew Obama was a traitor destroying our country.  He and Hill are guilty as sin of multiple crimes and your blustering generalities because you have nothing but blind hatred cultivated by propaganda that you can't even verify the source...much like the FISA court with the fake Russian conspiracy.  Grow up."
Donald J. Trump maybe if the dems are so concerned about Haiti the clinton foundation can explain what happened to all the money raised to rebuild Haiti but only 2% got there?? yes this needs looking into Mr President .
"Hollins Dorothy wrong. Liberal media doesnâ€™t care how our country looks as long as Trump is taking the blame. All they have to do is point the finger at him for calling a spade, a spade, while they spend 24 hours a day attacking their own President. They just want to make President Trump look bad. Itâ€™s called deflection."
"Hollins Dorothy I guess the same reason they lie about everything else. Anything to put deceit into the minds of Americans because the dems in power want Trump impeached, by whatever means necessary. Have you not seen the videos or photos of recruiting for riots online? For heavens sakes, President Trump could end world hunger forever, and the dems would lose their minds. Its nonsense! Dems do not want him in the office of President because he is not part of their cliques. Now, We the People had to endure 8 years of nightmare from Obama. We the People have to deal with dems attacking Trump supporters, mostly without them even know what hit them, We the People have to deal with biased and misleading news from MSM. And I pray that President Trump does not sneeze at the wrong time, otherwise dems would blow it out of proportion."
"I hate clinton & her scams but Fact is Haiti has been rebuilt like 5-6 times & everytime the natives go back to voodoo, murder & cannibalism & then they burn everything down & this has happened over and over after each countries government has literally built them cities & roads & school and hospitals"
"Hollins Dorothy Sorry lady, but Obungler made us the laughing stock of the world! pull your head out of your a$$ and see the facts!"
"Jeff Van Voorhees Exactly,this has been happening ever since Pappa Doc and son !"
Hollins Dorothy If you are still believing anything the lying mentally deranged liberal dems are spewing you have mental issues and should seek help.
"""Along with all the health care money Hillary Clinton blew away as Secretary of State"". -Chris Hitchens"
Or maybe Clinton can explained what happened to hundreds of Haitian  children!!
Shawn Cartwright And they are so busy deflecting that they are not doing the job they are in the position to do. .
"David Lloyd  Please forgive me, who is Pappa Doc and son? I never heard of them. Please explain. Thank you."
"The Democrats are just mad because most of the places they represent are shitholes, thanks to their Democratic Leadership"
"Reality check: Thanks to Republican leadership, red states contribute less money and take significantly more from the federal government than blue states.

"Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore etc......stop watching CNN."
No it's people like you turning this country into a shithole!
By the way there are red states that have bad areas too!
Until people can admit there's a problem these areas will not be helped. Keep burying your head in the sand little ostrich
Brandy John Ad hominem attacks are not an argument John.
Liam Joseph Hopley I do not understand what you were trying to say!
NY and California are the worst and they are both blue states!
"Liz Schmidt Yeah except thatâ€™s not even remotely true. California ranks #46 on the list of states by dependency on the federal government, so it is far from â€˜the worstâ€™. It is a net contributor to the federal government, meaning California puts in more money than it takes out. California has a GDP of $2.4T... thatâ€™s almost twice the GDP of the entire country of Canada. California is also currently running a $7.5 billion dollar surplus.Just another little reality check for you."
"Jeff WayRock So true. I live in a district that was finally going to vote out Darrell Isis (the richest man in the Congress)but he beat us to it, by deciding not to run again."
Kristin Jones Ott you don't know what you are talking about. I live 3 blocks from a beautiful ocean. Most of my neighbors are not conservative. The ones  that voted for Trump are regretting it and wish they hadn't.
Bonnie Louise Vandenberg I've been there many times. The Chesapeake Bay is beautiful but the city of Baltimore is a shithole.

Isn't Baltimore the city where the people told the police to leave and now are begging the police to come back ?!
"Meanwhile, Chelsea Clinton tweet-reacts in statement that Haiti helped build his buildings. When wikileaks helped find 3 million dollars in her wedding receipts from the unaccounted billions of dollars the world donated to the Clinton foundation for Haiti relief.

Hillary was a zionist shill for Israel and Marxist Communist Russia. Expose her Jewish roots and agenda and get 911 reinvestigated. Huma is Arabic from Saudi Arabia. Iran is no threat to the USA.

I would have loved to be a fly on the wall when Obama had his feet up on the resolute desk smoking a cig.. or whatever - imagine NEVER using some questionable language.. Câ€™mon!!
"It's not about questionble language! I bet you think it was the language that got women upset about the ""grab them by the pussy"" remark, too."
"Save a horse, ride a cowboy."
He was the only one that was classless enough to put his feet up on the desk of the oval office.
Lol Obama the War Mongering murderer you mean??
Trump voters talking about class. The definition of irony..
"Trolling shows a lack of class, too....How many of you classless people are trolling the President's facebook page?...jerks."
You have it all wrong guys. OBAMA wasn't smoking a cigar or ciggerettes. He was smoking that tranny wife's cock
Obama referred to white people as honks in meetings
Michael Winegardner  â€œWe are all born ignorant but one must work hard to remain stupidâ€ù. Benjamin Franklin.
"Hussein Obama=Arabic, Sunni from Saudi Arabia with no ties to Iran. He was kept in power by zionist Israel whom control America. 911 must be reinvestigated as the hijackers came from Saudi Arabia not Iran."
Like Bush put his feet on the desk? Or Ford?
They were all more classy than Nobama.  :D
And I would love to be in that room with a rolled up newspaper.
"Especially with his known love for gangsta rap and the ""artists"" who perform it."
"Hahahaha, delusional"
Riva Rivera there are many historical photographs of past presidents with their feet on the desk in oval office. Please stop being ignorant like our current president.
"I think that President Trump doesn't despise the Hispanics, in fact, we Venezuelans are very grateful for his actions against the Maduro dictatorship and we hope that President Trump will put an end to this horrible communist dictatorshi"

"Like when he only passed one piece of legislation, the rest EOs and then the circuit courts denied denied and denied??_Ÿ˜‚"
Typical liberal response; intolerant and pointless...
"Heâ€™s had 52 pieces of legislation passed, yes, heâ€™s signed a few EOâ€™s, but nothing like Emperor Barack I. Thatâ€™s why he was able to get rid of most of Barryâ€™s harmful (well, to anyone who works anyway) EOâ€™s and regulations in effect negating his entire presidency.As far as the 9th circuit goes, Theyâ€™re all libs and they always get overturned. With any luck, The President will cut it in two and appoint judges and attorneys who actually adhere to the constitution."
"John Eger I'm sorry John I must've missed the republican talking points from Obama's term.

Usually you want to make more than you spend.I must've missed the part where the US has been turned around by republican standards. Everything they complained about under Obama is the same or worse today.National debt has increasedThe deficit has increasedSpending has increasedNew job production has decreasedLayoffs have increasedPlease inform me"
The only GREAT thing trump has done is shown the world how mentally unstable and incompetent he is as a human being

zionists whom funded Hussein obama ailed to help all the American people. His Middle Eastern agenda never should have gone before helping all Americans and cities like Chicago. Investigate Obamas ties to 911 he is Arabic from Saudi Arabia. Iran is not threat to the world.
Anson Monestime II Iâ€™ll take your word for it.
And Virginia is a shithole state
Lol sorry snowflakes if the truth hurts

"It is rather ironic isn't it; Trump talks and gets crucified; Billy boy raped women, raped the Haitians and not a peep, just defends him to the end. People even the less literate and mentally challenged can't be that blind."

Exactly! So disgusting!

People like Susanne make me hate Trump more.
Justin Johnson you can move to Haiti
"Justin Johnson Best Economic growth in over 10 YEARS. Record breaking Stock Market. My retirement account is up over 30 %, ISIS being decimated, Unemployment at a 17 (SEVENTEEN) YEAR LOW, Excellent Tax breaks, Pay Raises and Bonuses. IF that's turning America into a Shithole, I'll take it."

"Last I heard, Haiti is mad at the Clinton's for not giving them all the money that was collected through their corrupt foundation. President Trump, you are doing a great job!"
"Zionist Clinton agenda. ""When will Hillary pay back all the health care funds she blew away as Secretary of State creating the single greatest health care crisis of the 21st Century?"" Chris Hitchens"
"too bad the people that are supposed to keep the public informed ""the media"" are caught up in their own agenda..oh well..thank goodness for SOCIAL MEDIA and a President that lets the insults and lies roll right off his back..we know who has credibility..keep up the good work"
zionist facebook is going to try to limit freedom of speech. Remember to find a way to always speak freely.
"You people are so stupid!  Limit your freedom to say what you want, what makes you think that?  Do you even know what zionist means?"
yes and it is called lying corrupt liberals and rat democrats
"Alex Breed Love you need to see a shrink. stop stalking women on here, Pervert.You are a liberal troll wanting her information to stalk"
Trump lets the insults and lies roll out of his mouth and into his Twitter feed.
Delusional fool!

You are a business man, not a politician, and being an Administreative Assistant for an executive for 25 years, I know how you think.  Thank you for taking this country on and trying to get it back into shape. God bless you!"
the media are leftists?
"Gill Putaranui   Oh  Yeah,  big time liberals"
It's the truth! Why does the media have to have everything sugar coated for them? Guess what? We have a ton of shithole cities right here in the USA!

And they are run by democrats _Ÿ_”

So true No sugar here! Lol! Dems are the scourge of America!
Yes you are right

Where were all these complaints when Hillary robbed Haiti blind... where was the outrage then... democrats arenâ€™t even hiding their ignorance anymore...
"Great, bring up Clinton. Shame."
Actually idc either way Iâ€™m just stunned by the fact that Haiti was robbed by the clintons and the media was silent besides Fox News that is and then all the sudden trump says some mean words and the whole media is ready to send him to his maker... it is worst than obvious at this point and people need to be fired like the entire media and all of congress and even the president but hey if you wanna say yeah bring up the clintons I mean y not they are the one screwing everyone but most loved by the media...
"""But Hillary . . ."" LOL"
John Borowski Why not?
Scott Hill _Ÿ™„
Thatâ€™s all they can say... but it says it all
pointing out that Haiti is a S....Hole is fine. We should also point out that the Clintons helped Haiti maintain the SH status.
The Clintons and Sean Penn - reprobates.
Amen
Amen!!!
Stoled their money
exactly right!
"Even if he did say it, and it hasn't been proven that he did, what's the big deal? Haiti is a shithole."
America is getting nuts. Itâ€™s becoming where you canâ€™t say anything. Screw them

"Wash Post story, 1% true 99% false Anonymous sources.  Trump said he used strong language but denies the comment as quoted in the Washington Post. So the question isn't why are people surprised, the question really is why do you believe everything the left tells you?"

"Muffy Alvord I was wondering the same thing.  Is there any audio record of the statement?  Not saying it wasn't said, but are we to rely on the good word of the Democrats, because God knows, they'd never fabricate a negative story about Trump."
Chris Steves the question is why do you cult members believe ANYTHING he says?
Carlos = Troll
WRONG! Trump is JEWISH. His grandmothers last name is kolber. There is a reason all of his children are Jewish and married to Jewish people. He doesn't even know the words to the American anthem. All of his business partners are Jewish. He is buddies with Larry Silverstein the owner of the world trade center. No way he is a white christian patriot. His love for Israel is at the expense of Americans and the entire globe. He is 100 Jewish.
Andy = Troll
"Sorry Andy, I stand corrected on your comment.  Andy = Not a Troll."
"Carlos, President Trump tells the truth. Something Americans have not been used to in decades."
Chandler = Troll
Haiti being a shithole is not a racial issue.  It is a fact.
"Carlos,  you clearly are being misled by your liberal buddies. You are the bigot here."
"Lol, Victoria. What the hell does it matter if he IS of Jewish heritage. Hmmmm?"

Diane Hillila trust & Trump in the same sentence...?
Yessssss...If it walks like as duck and talks like a duck...it's a freaking duck stupid
It is a shithole. It's also a country that the Clintons aren't welcome. They went there full of hope and change and then ran a giant scam on them. But you libcunts are AOK with that.
I love that you have told the truth about how the Clintons exploited these poor people._Ÿ˜˜
Thereâ€™s a shithole in your profile pic

Liberals don't have to do anything to make Cap'n Dipshit look bad.  He does it all himself.
"funny thing is the ""unnamed source"" wasn't in the meeting, they claimed to have been briefed on the meeting. I say POTUS names everyone in the meeting,then media can question each of them, to see if they heard it and or who they briefed that would lie about the meeting."

You mean you have no class. We already know that.
"Being 'politically correct' means trying not to offend people.  If there one way to describe Trump, it's offensive!"
Andy Johnston your confusing offend with truth about the country. He never said the people.  That's a liberal add on.

We're behind you sir. Sometimes the truth hurts. Its a wake up call too. No one is busting a nut to emigrate to Haiti. The reasons are obvious as you pointed out
Stand behind liar. Nice job.
"If You're argument is that all politicians are liars, then I have no reply. But to not see the accomplishments he has done already, with or without lying mind you, then you're in denial. But continue to be anti American if you want. But I refuse to give up on this great country."
His language might be crude but then it is the type of language people seem to understand. He made his point even to the democrats.
Terry McGinn supporters keep saying he has achieved great things but have yet to tell the rest of the world exactly what are these things.
"You're joking: stock market booming, economy booming, tax cut for working folks, Isis under control, unemployment way down. I guess you're right, He's done nothing. Stop crying and accept the fact that while you may hate him, the results of his actions have helped Americans greatly. Either way, you can continue to criticize this country, but the majority of Americans have decided not to put up with this losing attitude any longer. So shape up kiddo"
Linda Heslegrave do you still live in stepmoms basement with no outside communication? _Ÿ__â€çâ™‚ï¸è

Linda Heslegrave Stop listening to CNN who never reports what Trump has done! and you might learn something.
What about the shithole that your people escaped from?
John Borowski turns out it was Dick Durbin that is the lier and Conspiracy Nut News spreads the lies.
"John Petraitis I did work hard and escaped a bad situation. Maybe you did too, and good for you. But don't talk about vulgar statements when you have f*** trump on your home page. Wouldn't this fall into the area of hypocrisy?"
"My brother in law was a missionary in Haiti, and though he worked endless hours a day for the people, it was the government officials and those well to do that made Haiti what it was.  Sad situation where the democrats even made money while swindling it for their coffers and not help the people."
Right..a shithole...not our fault
Its like that in alot of countries the leaders keep the people in dire situations so the people flee to America and othe well to do countries then the people send their money back to their home countries and the leaders pocket a huge portion of the money
"Maybe Haiti wouldn't be such a ""sh*thole"" if the Clinton's hadn't stolen all of their earthquake relief money......Just a thought..."

And please be aware that not everyone wants to emigrate to the USA, especially Norwegians who live in the wealthiest country in the world."
"Linda Heslegrave of course not everyone wants to come here. And youâ€™re right? There are African countries that are completely fine. But he isnâ€™t taking about those.

They have lots of kids and fake marry over and over to bring more of their own in.  They work low level jobs and spread bed bugs everywhere.  They dont integrate, they just group up with eachother and reproduce to get more welfare.  I saw how they tramsformed an entire area.  The workers are lazy and sloppy.  Mexicans (and others from that region) can run a kitchen, but then replaced by Haitians and the kitchens run like crap.  Sure there are a few decent, but most are snakes and live in filth because that's the culture.  At least those are the ones we got. That's the problem.  Its not like they made a section of town nice or interesting.  They made it embarrassing.  Tourists think they are in a ghetto.  Trash and mattresses left out by the road, etc."

(Norwegians take English lessons from Grade 1 through 12 and generally speak English without an accent).  It's refreshing that Trump is trying to get the US back to respectability by using his business sense and attitude."
"What is the point calling Haiti and some Africans countries ""shitholes"" other than hurt the people from these places?"

Even if you did it's okay. I wouldn't like to live there...and I don't know anybody that would. We could send the democrats to live there...
Hollins Dorothy - Apparently you don't read the news. It is full of fake news about Trump.
Hollins Dorothy Why would they make it up? You have got to be kideding.
"Hollins Dorothy, MD's visiting Haiti to help have said worse about the conditions in Haiti."
Hollins Dorothy Why you say? Just like they made up fake  stories in the past.
Bo Petersen Fake president!
Michel Lesieur - Please stick to your own country...and your own prime minister....
Good idea
Yep. Make dems escort all illegals back. Work to improve their lives at real homes. Win win!
Hollins Dorothy So the President hurt your felling ok cry baby you want a bottle!!!!! Grow up!!!!!!
The Clinton's and Bush should be the ones the offended take this point up with.. The USA under a Hypothetical President Hillary Clinton will end up like Haiti.. Thank you Lord and continue to protect our great President and his family!
Sonya the Suck Up...Idiot.
Arturo the Libtard.. Way to stay classy..
I stated my opinion.. State yours..
That's what I thought
"Yes, that was going to be my suggestion. Record your meeting. Even most of your party doesn't have your back but will stab you in the back."
Exactly!!!
"Yes, please be ultra careful!"
"Which is worse: calling Haiti a ""shithole"" (which, according to my friends who have been there, it IS) or stealing all the money people donated to make Haiti better?"
"Yep, that money raised went right into the Clinton's pockets."
EXACTLY!
No meetings without recording......he is right ....NO TRUST! Just like the police with body cams.
No brainer! What say you Dems?????
"The news channel that we watched after stating that they were going to let people hear what President Trump said, did no such thing! We heard nothing of the sort! It doesn't surprise me because they are always trying to change what was really said to suit their agenda! It's truely sickening!!! We support President Trump!"
Absolutely! All the way! BEST PRESIDENT EVER!!! MAGA!
"If you called Haiti a ""S___hole,"" it would only be the truth.  I would not hold that against you.  It is obvious that country, among quite a few other, is literally not just poor, but corrupt, criminal, dangerous, and failing.  I think that ""S___hole"" is quite frankly a very concise and accurate description; however, not a Politically Correct term.  Personally, I care more about accuracy of statement and truth than the PC Culture."
"Has anyone mentioned that crime cartels have taken over Puerto Rico again?  They are ****hole countries because demon rats, crime cartels / commies / Fascism control their countries and they do nothing about it because they canâ€™t or wonâ€™t change_Ÿ˜¢_Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ_¬"
"I think you're missing the point Brian Cox.  He didn't say ""Haiti is a shithole"", he said, â€œWhy are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?â€ù  So apparently, America is only for immigrants from pleasant countries like Norway.  Wealthy white countries.  You don't exclude people because their government is corrupt or their compatriots are poor or brown."
"Matt Parker, if you want to turn America into the places President Trump denies calling ""S___holes, you invite bus loads, boat loads, train loads, and even make sure there are no fences so they can enter our borders un-vetted and then give them sanctuary and money out of the pockets of every American citizen."
"did you ever wonder why are 3rd world countries that way, and why is America like it is?!! It all comes down to WHO you worship and honor. Many poor countries have been dedicated to the devil by their witch doctors which brings in evil. America was dedicated to Our Father, Son and Holy Ghost and honored in some churches and His work carried out in the world. You are either releasing good or evil; the Bible tells you to choose God and Live!"
Says Brian â€œSuxâ€ù Cox
"John Petraitis, geez, I tginkntgey first time I heard that I was in kindergarten, maybe first grade.You know what though, we didn't have rules that got us kicked out of grade school and labeled a ""bully"" for fighting back then.If you said that then, you didn't get your momma to come protect you, so consequently, not a lot of kids said that to me.LOL, now, when ""snowflakes"" like you spout off, I just laugh because I'm pretty sure you'd of spent recess in the Library in my era."
I think we all do! Tell it like it is President Trump! We love you!
I love you President Trump because you're the only US president that tell Africans the truth. Previous American governments have been too diplomatic and giving aid that has made Africa poorer and more dependent.
"Good Morning Patricia, Iâ€™d like for us to be friends & get to know each other. Clarence"
"Mr. Okere shame on you, you should know better."
Oh yes I know better! I'm African and I live in Africa. The west has done nothing but make Africa more lazy and dependent!
Some people feel they can cry more than the bereaved. Africa needs to start working rather than begging.
George Okere...u are actually the shithole his talking abt...with low self esteem
"Well thank goodness you didn't promise them schools and hospitals after collecting hundreds of millions, then putting it in a scandalous foundation and pay for Chelsea's wedding with it. That would be horrible!!!!"
"How do they even have the nerve to show their faces in public? They should be so so humiliated, but their not! Thereâ€™s the sign of a true Sociopath!"
"Haiti is a SHITHOLE and Democrats have successfully turn US cities such as; Detroit, Chicago, and New York City into SHITHOLES as well. Speak the truth Democrats stop pretending that you don't say words like that. #Fakeshock@DNC."
Shame on you.
John Borowski Shame on me for calling it like it is?? Shame on you for shaming people to conform to your ideas and beliefs. You are just a stalker who wants using shame to quiet the people who speak their minds. Get a life and leave innocent people alone.
"if Haiti  is a shithole, your governments are the primary contributors. they control almost everything in Haiti. go to ask your ambassadors to give some explanations about what they are doing as activities in that shithole. US media never tell you that most of images they project about Haiti are selected in a way to show you Haiti is a shithole country while they use this country as their garden to increase the wealthiness. And you should know also if Haiti is a shithole today for your government, in the past it was a cooperator of USA helping your country to get freedom. Please, go to read your history!"
Its funny they're you're all agreeing Haiti and Africa are shitholes. Ok live with that and that should be your problem!
Jamesy Joseph I know the history and Hillary Clinton ROBBED the Haitians. I don't don't know the last time you were in the US but Democrats who run major cities here have succeeded in running them into the ground like Haiti.
"with all that has transpired since inauguration, this dude can by no means be 100% sane. It was just too much and it's only 12/01/2018. hell."
He is making America great again.
"How can you tell from half a globe away?  Only through what other people and the TV tell you... your opinion is based on 2nd hand information, pre-digested by other people."
"Yes, he is making positive changes to the American society. Not debating that. But with the media circus, Russia investigation, hiring and firing (even if it is 2nd hand info) and all that...wouldn't that start to destabilize any normal right-minded person."
"Mathew Janser nope, We deplorables stand by President Trump!"
Nelson Parker Did you mean deportable or deplorable. You got me confused.
"Millions of people are praying for The President , and the power of Hell will not prevail. This is just another Democrats attack that will backfire"
"If a person takes 2nd hand information as fact, then yes, the person will be destabilized.  But when a person's view of the world is primarily based on other peoples pre-digested opinions, then I would argue that person was not very stable to begin with... stable people tend to be more objective/sceptical and are not that easily influenced by hyperbole.I think most people are smarting up and realizing that it's not nearly as grim as the media has made it out to be... the media has been wrong on so many accusations.  They really need to stop getting ahead of themselves or we won't even know how to tell when Trump actually does something really bad...Let's look back 14 months ago, remember all the things the media said would happen if Trump got elected?  In summary, the claim was that the world would pretty much end...  The stock market would crash, Gay marriage would be repealed, Nuclear war, Blacks would be deported, Even legal citizens would be deported, etc.You quickly realize that they were wrong on just about every doomsday claim that they made...  and by large measure, they are still wrong today."
Mathew Janser How many cabinet members did Obungler hire and fire during his term???
Glenda Brossette he's an embarrassment.
"Kai Sarasch Finally , a rational individual!"
Mathew Janser Still talking about Russia  LMAO!
GROW A BRAIN LIBTARD!
"Marie Marcucci Nobody wants to lift the ""cloud"" over his head."
Cindy McGrady so are you js..
What . It's 1/11/18. President Trump has done more for this country in 11 months than Obummer in 8 yrs .
Go complain about your own country and leave our President alone.
Maybe your statement should say... With all the false statements the snowflakes have heard and not a one found to hold any water.. Are the snowflakes the one's who are off their rocker to continue these insane accusations. Is it the snowflakes that are insane due to not even caring about all the REAL crimes being committed? Is it the snowflakes that need to realize they are following the one's who are corrupt?
Thatâ€™s 01/12/18.
Since you do not live in this country and are not a US citizen you apparently have an opinion that does not matter to US.

"Clintons have deep pockets from Haiti. Embezzling 90% of Haiti earthquake relief funds, has turned Haiti into a â€œshâ€”"
Haiti should swear out dead or alive international arrest warrants for 3 clintons and all employees and   Present and former board who stole charity. Scum to build one house. Seize all money worldwide of that criminal family and foundation.  Get them Haiti.
"But, but, but...THE CLINTONS!"
"Third world countries like Haiti are called third world for a reason.  If you've ever watched the news, you've probably seen clips of elderly and children digging through mounds of garbage at garbage dumps looking for food or recyclables for money.  Maybe their leaders should do what they were elected to do rather than line their own pockets while keeping their people in misery."
Sort of like promising Repeal and Replace with the Best Health Care for Everyone??
"Josh Cooper Josh. stay on point.  Trump should have known what he said would get to the fake press(like he cares), but what's to debate about the state of those countries? Why can't America take immigrants based on merit--or does 'everyone get a trophy'?  Give Trump more time.  Once he gets rid of the leakers and 'never Trumpers', a new healthcare plan will come out.  Wouldn't need to Repeal and Replace if Obama didn't lie to the American people ad naseum."
Part of Haitiâ€™s salvation was supposed have been supported by the Clinton Foundation. Instead Bill bought them a bunch of tents and confiscated the millions in funding relief that his foundation received. Another reason to imprison him and his hag.
Itâ€™s all so disgusting isnâ€™t it?

"Trump is correct. Tell me exactly how importing millions of poverty stricken, illiterates into the nation will make the country better and improve the quality of your life and mine."
Get off your high horse. Typical Trump voter...
Sounds perfectly logical to me Laura... some people won't be happy until we ourselves are a Shithole Nation...
"Well, your part of American is a â€œsâ€”t holeâ€ù.  So, you would know exactly what its like living in one."
"Wait, wasnâ€™t his entire voting base poverty stricken illiterates?!"
They are already here in South Florida. Haitans took over there. Not nice people.
"Randi Lauren true. I guess if you are poor, you are a bad person! Geez, unbelievable!"
People will say anything to bring you down. So sad this country has gotten so far off of base. This gal from Idaho is still rooting for you. Keep your chin up Mr. President.
hang in there Mr President. Do no let them take you down.
Even if he did say it he is right. There are millions of people from Europe that would love to immigrate to the US. They should be the priority.
Even if he is right he shouldn't say that. Guess trumpers didn't have good mommas.....
Why not? The truth hurts liberal snowflakes? Out with political correctness. Say it as it is.
"Please explain why Europeans ""should be the priority."""
Carol Biophilia Lovell-Saas That is easy. They are educated people that wouldn't be a burden to anybody. With the recent muslim invasion of Europe I am sure it would be easy to find people wanting to move to the USA.
Hollins Dorothy Where did I blame democrats? It is nice of you to admit that democrats are the problem
Americans should be the priority lol
"Anson Monestime II Without ""lol"" Americans sahould be the priority but if you are going to take immigrants why take the worst? If you are employer would you rather hire the best or the worst candidate?"
"You really think anyone from Norway would want to emigrate to a ""shithole"" country like ours?"

"There it is - ""But Clinton . . ."""
"Scott Hill no, itâ€™s butt Clinton"
yea just think ofthe countless haitian children brought back for the friends of clintons.
"Letâ€™s be honest. Iâ€™ve been to Haiti, it is a â€œ- - - - hole.â€ù Diversity as an immigration policy is ridiculous. We have plenty diversity in this great country. We should be bringing in people based on their skills rather than the country they reside in or the color of their skin. How about already educated engineers, scientists, teachers, computer experts, rather than people with no skills that have to be taken care of and educated."
why don't you tell to your citizens also during your visit you realize how much your country contribute in the construction of this shithole? you would be honest in this case.
"Apparently the countries that he referred to ARE ""shitholes"".... otherwise the people from them would want to stay there and help build their own country and  not be wanting to migrate to the United States. How can you argue that point?"
You are a sickening person. You defend a pig.
"John Borowski I have been to some of the countries POTUS named, trust me they are horrible places. Many of them are breeding grounds for terrorist organizations."
Never believe anything the lying news media says especially when itâ€™s said about you. CBSâ€™s reporting on this yesterday really made them look bad.
Where was the outrage when Killary Clinton took and laundered millions of dollars from the Haitian Government and charitable donations through their Clinton Foundation.   When was the last time you seen a  single American citizen schedule a dream vacation to Haiti?  Liberals always use the race card to justify their rediculous analogues to common sense thinking most of us have.
woe and shame on the Clintons for stealing all that money
Perhaps Mr. President you should fleece and defraud the country like the Clinton foundation and her cronies did when they had a natural disaster. Go on TV and announce billions in aid and of course deliver nothing. The left applauds that.
Trump will not do that. He is trying to go by the book and that is something DEMS do not do. They go by their greed and tantrums.
snowflakes just cant handle the truth.. its ok what you said.. them countries are shitholes... just like the shithole bars down 63rd st. in Chicago now them a shitholes.
That's what i said in a previous comment...Chicago and lots of areas in California...are S*holes.
Joseph Soto lolool.. I'm saying the Bars/Clubs/Lounges down 63rd st are shitholes.. I think u missd the message...  Chicago is a great city
Very Presidential!
"Well, even if you did refer to Haiti as a shithole you would be correct. We have parts of this country that meet that description. But please do not give the liberal snowflakes any more ammo, you are dealing with politically correct babies."
Youâ€™re a ignorant shithole
Greg Rammairone Now you are showing your true colors. Go suck a pacifier snowflake.
Greg Rammairone Please provide the link that proves that President Trump said that... And do not give me the several reports that he said it... i want proof
So true@haitiisashitholecorruptedcountrysotgatswhyistayinusa
"Be yourself Donald J. Trump , the dems liberals are - with few exceptions - mentally diseased. So are many republicans so basically stick to your guns, drain the swamp and you will forever be know as the president who saved the free world, democracy and civilization."
Be himself?  That says a lot about you  telling a 71 years old to continue to act 10 years old.
"SirKeenan Burgess Flawed person no doubt like every other being in the known universe. You guys have all these one liners assuming you have the monopoly on a universal truth and superior morality. You act like a herd, speak and think the same. However you lack any fundamental knowledge or comprehension regarding the perils of ever growing government power (whose reps are Shitlary Clinton, Obama, and the other socialists), you have no understanding of how crucial separation of powers, keeping government in check, fostering individual creativity and even eccentricity are. You always pick form over substance because you have no idea what substance is. Lemmings."
"Bogdan Udubasa well said, I love that Trump is brutally honest."
"Haiti is a sh** hole, when I was there we were trying to give US Navy t shirts out. The police came in and put guns to people's heads to take the shirts away. They were putting people in shipping containers as a jail cell. If you wanna cry about a place being a sh** hole or not, first go there and put boots on the ground."
"Then durring the Haitian crisis we housed  hundreds of refugees in the well deck of the USS Tortuga LSD 46. We gave them bedding, hot meals, showers, reading material and so on. We did the best we could do considering how many there were. They burned the bedding and books, tried to smuggle in weapons, destroyed the showers, there were cases of rape and they went against everything we tried to help with"
Sounds right. They have taken over South Florida. Not nice people.
Everywhere u can't put things underground not only Haiti if u have nothing to say shut your mouth
Hey Benjamen Loui try reposting your comment and think it through this time.
I've kicked dirt all over the world so really don't know what your getting at.
"Mr. President, remember when our workers went to Haiti after a disaster and they jailed our American workers for child abduction when they were trying to get children help? That Country is a disaster and they have no regard for us."
"Dems are worried because of how much good press he got after the bipartisan meeting earlier in the week.  Had to make something up, straight from their usual playbook."
"Fake news for sure.   Please donâ€™t stopTweeting or posting on FB.   That is the real news.   Love you and your family and the fantastic job you are doing.  Keep setting the record straight!   Sad you have to do that but so glad you do!!!!!  ThNk goodness for Twitter Fb and Fox News right?!"
"You seriously believe that Trump called Haiti and Africa ""s**hole countries"" is fake news?"
"Of course, I know you won't answer"
"I do not believe that is what she said. As far as what he said, he is absolutely correct."
"Unless you were actually in the meeting and heard him supposedly say that  you canâ€™t say it isnâ€™t fake news.  I would believe the President before CNN abc msnbc or abc or a Democrat/liberL.  And thatâ€™s my option   It has been proven so many times thAt the mainstream media is very bias against trump and doesnâ€™t report anything good or accomplishment on our President Trump.   The mainstream media is doomAnd gloom and fake as a rule. No praise or truth.  stopBeing so gullible   They did the same with all the other republican presidents"
"If Haiti is so great, why all these people with TEMPORARY status are not eager to go back? Ask them. #1 reason would be ""because it is a shithole""!"
Because they helped America fight 1779 go take a look at the American story
"I know the history. But if we are going to make our immigration decisions based on history, we would have to ban English, French and Germans :) That was a dummy comment on your part, sorry"
"They are just like your great parents came over to America. They didn't need paperwork, did they? If they get deported, do you really think you were born in the US? Might not even existed to be a xenophobic.  You didn't choose the US, but they did."
"Odilon Ramarozafy I am a first generation immigrant. And I am surely came here LEGALLY. SO I did the things right way.And please, stop bringing the past. When people came here 100 years ago, US was surely a different country, so you cannot judge then and now."
"US showed these people great compassion by bringing them here after horrible earthquake (I do not think anybody else did), but 8 years later it, it is not US fault that billions of dollars sent to Haiti were corruptibly wasted and the country remains a ""shithole"""
"Mr. President, you should wear one of those body camera's that the police wear so you can prove the media is constantly lying to the American people."
"Yes, then we could get a play-by-play of his many many many many many many many many golf games."
Cool! Maybe I can pick up some pointers to approve my game.
Thatâ€™s a great idea!!
Lol that would be hilarious!!! Media would have a field day with that and start spinning like insane spiders lol!!!
"Haiti is in the condition its in due to their corrupt government, of which has been in place for decades, has nothing to do with our president. Mr. President---keep your friends close, and your ""enemies"" closer--recording close-door meetings is a good idea---should stop the leakers."
"Yep, good idea!"
"Everything a Dem touches turns into a Shithole.   RIP Detroit, all inner cities.  Unless the place is gorgeous and exclusive-but the smug is intolerable in those places."
Say wha?? Make sense please.
"JoAnn DeAngelo The last part of his comment is vague, but I agree with his first sentence."
Richard Mark think he meant smog.
"Said it or didn't. The truth is it is a shi*hole. Millions thrown into a country, and no progress has ever been made. Advice to the President, have all meetings recorded, not just the Dems are waiting to take you down, many Republicans are too. I hope you would do less tweets, just gives them ammunition against you. Stay strong and fight on. Thank You."
"Just a thought, if you must Tweet, to start your day,Tweet out Good Morning America, Have a great day... I'm sure that would be twisted and spun by the media... lol"
Trisha Lew-Lew which country are you talking about ?
No need to explain. Liberals make things up all the time. Third world countries have awful conditions. Nothing wrong with calling it like it is. That's why we voted for a non politician.

Talley Wacker
Aww isn't that sweet a teacher. I feel sorry for your students.
"From Quebec - Canada -  Haiti is a poor country,  having a serious problem of governance since always and needing funds of the World as far as I am remembering to exist.     It isn't  inappropriate  to call the things by the right words, it is the reflet of the majority of people.    WE are so bored of DEMS-Liberals - supporting Sanctuaries of illegals-druggs-lack of security etc... (absolutely at the opposite of our minds to have a good Admnistration) and FAKE NEWS at your Place and others as for me in Canada (following  exactly the same informations given daily by your Fake News).   WE I am supporting and loving you Mr. President Trump and so proud to have you there at White House - Keep up the JOB.  Ask God to protect and guide you in the right way  as your great Plan to act  in your Presidency."
"Hey. Don't bring Canada into this mess. Just say Quebec, then everyone understands."
"Jackie Cannon-Wilvert HEY - I am a quebecer  and canadian  Dyed-in-the-Wool  and - HEY - I will continue to say the right words as they are - UNDERSTAND THAT Jackie Cannon-Wilvert - HEY -  O.K.    Love  and  Support  Mr. President trump  since Day 1 elected for the good reasons for happiness - prosperity - security of his loved people and his country U.S.,   He takes care of his people and it is  WONDERFUL"
The truth if the matter is the Haiti have long over stayed there temporary disaster help. The word temporary does not mean come over and take advantage of are kindness and never leave. Do socialist democrats and foreigners under stand that temporary does not mean forever!
Haiti never got out of disaster relief status because the clients steal it all.
"When it wasn't disasters, it was corrupt government."
Apparently not! And neither does our government or immigration Dept.
"Don't worry about it, President Trump. It's common knowledge, that the media can't report anything about you, without lying. The good and decent American people elected you, and we stand with you! Keep up the great work! MAGA!"
"Your god said he did not say that word, so, are you going to retract yours now too? And repeat what and how wonderful his words are? For a change, I can witness a wonderful word coming from a Certified Trumpster like you. _Ÿ˜‚"
"So, Reginald, with what you said having been said, are you a supporter of President Trump or what?"
"Terry Knight, I didn't make a lick of since out of what he said! _Ÿ_”"
"I couldn't understand either, Jeff."
"Everyone so incensed because he spoke the truth.  Fact is, if Mexico, Haiti, Syria, and all these countries were SO fabulous-their people wouldnâ€™t be coming here. Iâ€™ve yet to hear of an American saying they canâ€™t wait to move to Mexico or Haiti and are willing to do so illegally if they canâ€™t via legal channels.  Back when Trump became President not one celebrity said they were going to move to Haiti."
"I canâ€™t wait to move to Mexico. There you go, youâ€™ve heard an American say that. Youâ€™re welcome."
"Well, no one is stopping you! Maybe you will be the start to positive change there so citizens will want to stay in their own country."
Fernando Armas-Contreras toodles ..
"sounds like something the low life crooked demo-rats would do, twist your words to make you look bad. Yes, record all the meetings and start making these cowards accountable for their actions"
Absolutely! Record all meetings and release the recordings to the public. Then Donnie won't be able to repeatedly lie about what he said.
Haiti is a shithole because of the leadership in charge that skimmed off each and every bit of financial aid they ever received.  He is living in a palace while the majority of people of Haiti live in shanties and cardboard huts.  If only there was some foundation which would promise to help out with their plight ...ahem... Clinton Foundation (rolling eyes).
Hillary the zionist
Let the TRUTH set you free!
"Friend of mine (anonymous) said it perfectly: ""Would Haiti be such a shithole if the Clinton cash was really invested there?"""
Blame the Clintons. Typical..Wasn't that in that book Clinton Cash .??? You believe everything written about the Clintons yet not about Trump??
George M Green That's right you Nazi!_Ÿ–•_Ÿ_ª_Ÿ–•
Your friend is totally right  and George M Green is hysteric
Haiti has always been a shithole; even before the disasters
It would be in a LOT BETTER SHAPE than it is now. Thatâ€™s for Sure!
The American people see right through their nonsense Mr. President. We trust you. Thatâ€™s why you got elected. This is the first time in my life Iâ€™ve seen a president actually actively go through his campaign promises like a â€œto-do listâ€ù and get things done. Thanks for being accountable to us. Now we just have to get congress to help you and not keep your hands tied.
We need to start getting people in who will contribute to this country that also work and not just come here for free hand outs. Germany and other countries in Europe need to immigrate to get out of that mess their leaders have made.Am sure people in Sweden are desperate to get out of there.
The ones who live around me all are on welfare. Now seeing even older ones pregnant!! Should have been sent back years ago!!
"We knew what you meant. We voted for you. If Haiti and El Salvador werent shitholes then why are their entire populations seeking to come here. If it's so great, go back, but it isn't. Don't recant Mr President, we know what you mean. Were sick  of these poor people coming here."
"Yeah...cause the Statue of Liberty specifically says ""Give me your rich folks who are well off and thriving"" ... _Ÿ˜’"
"Leah Hall The Statue of Liberty is not American made, it was a 'gift' to the US.  Sorry, but things have changed dramatically, and probably because of the Statue"
"Kimberly Daniel Babb I don't think they checked for ""rich"" though...."
If the Dems are so upset about the bad treatment and language  why didnâ€™t they scream when Hillary Clinton and her boys went in there and robbed the place of recovery money and then built expensive housing and hotels on a part of the island not damaged by earthquake??  Double standard?  Clearly they are not defending Haiti but are attacking you.  Sad. No one has mentioned Obamâ€™s decree against Cubans just before he left office.
Maybe the reason Haiti is so poor and troubled is because of the fleecing they were given by the Clintons
Hi
Zionist  Hillary robbed them
Record everything. Then when they make these false lies against you can just released what was said. it's the only way you're going to be able to prove the truth.  Before each meeting say this is being recorded so nobody can say you're secretly recording them
Whether you said it or not you did not lie. If those countries aren't s.holes then send their people home and why would anybody want to leave such great countries.  Maybe somebody should be asking where that Haiti money is.
You disgust me.
John Borowski did she hurt your feelings
"Thank you Mr President for speaking directly to us the people! We understand and love you, even if the out of touch with the reality of our country and we the American people... do not...we know when you speak you are warning us and letting us in on stuff coming like the Fisa and you want choice in who comes into our country...we support you fully! You get us! Thank you for protecting us!Pray everyday for you and yours for wisdom strength endurance and protection!"
"He could cure cancer and the libtards would try to turn it against him. Who cares what they think.It's nice to finally have a president that tells it like it is."
Amen.
100%!!!!!!!!!!
Everything you say will be spun to the worst extent.  Most intelligent people understand and the others canâ€™t handle the truth.
"they are ""S-H"" countries for the most part and rightfully so after being run and ruined by Liberal Socialist gov. Democrats want the worst to come here and get free gov tax payer assistance so they can expand their voter base ""a pure burden on the US and working class tax payers. Republicans want the best and brightest to come here and expand America's business in a 100% diverse way, entering the job market and supporting our great nation."
"The people of Haiti were harmed by the Clintons and by their own government. It's not their fault, but Haiti is a sh*thole. Why pretend otherwise?"
"zionist clintons whom also ""blew away America's health care funds"". -Hitchens"
"I heard what you said! The country are â€œcrap holesâ€ù not its people!! The governments are corrupt and suppress their people! The Liberals complaining only use countries like Haiti to steal , oh 8 million or so dollars in government relief funds, Like the Clintons!"
I much rather want someone to lie and tell me how much they love haiti and then steal money from them behind their backs. That's how politicians are supposed to do this.
hillary is your man then XD
"Key word ""Man"""
"zionist clinton agenda.""She blew away all the health care funds for Americans as Secretary of State"" Hitchens"
How they love to twist the truth!  It's  a shame you have to resort to recording but it will probably work to your advantage since you seem to be surrounded by those who want to cause harm to you.  You are the best President this country has ever had or probably ever will have and I thank you for the sacrifice you are making to restore our nation to the powerhouse it used to be. We love you!
"They are leakers, they should be prosecuted.  It is shocking that participants of a meeting with the President would be leaked to the press.  It is downright criminal."
"He is only telling the truth and thatâ€™s what everyone is thinking, only no one said it out loud. Look at this picture.Where is the outrage when the Clintons stiffed Haiti of all of the donations during their calamity? Please , enough hypocrisy.by Arabella Buot"
The Clinton Foundation has hurt Haiti more than anyone.  Collapse the foundation and send all that money directly to the people.
WHY would anyone be upset by someone saying what a country actually is?  All you have to do is research and you can find out the conditions of any country.  The DemoRats and Libs will take any opportunity to incite the sheeple!
"These pompous liberals act like they've never heard the word ""shithole"" before.  They've said worse about you and your family. Don't sweat it. We see the hypocrisy... we see it as clearly as we see Oprah kissing Harvey Weinstein. Keep calm and #MAGA."
"He did not say the Haitians were ____ _____. He referred to their countries using those words. There is a big difference between calling a person a name and referring to where they live as a bad place. I used this as a learning tool with students today. One has to be careful when they read an article as to WHAT was said and then what was inferred or reported by the media. If you have been to Haiti, then you know what the country is like - not pretty."
"Mr President,please ignore the fake media news.  You are doing a great job!  God bless you for keeping your words during your campaign.  We, the American people, loves you!  Trump 2020!!! _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‘ç_Ÿ‘ç_Ÿ™è_Ÿ™è"
Didn't he promise Mexico was going to pay for the wall? How does that 18 billion from your tax dollars feel ? _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚
Hispana de mierda _Ÿ’© _Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ˜¡
"Nicole Candray Por que Hispana de mierda?  She has a right to believe in a safe and prosperous country!  Just because we have a Hispanic heritage it doesn't mean that we approve lawlessness and the ripping off of the tax payer.  Besides if you want to have a civil discussion these words that you use are not only offensive but also insulting, civil discussion requires civility.  Also this is an English speaking country the last I check."
"Your god said he did not say that word, so, are you going to retract yours now too? And repeat what and how wonderful his words are? For a change, I can witness a wonderful word coming from a Certified Trumpster like you. _Ÿ˜‚"
"If he said that it's the truth.  Remember the Haiti policeman in Minneapolis who shot and murdered a woman while she was talking to his partner, and the female Mayor supported him and no more was said.  Deport them now."
Haitians in s Florida are trump supporters   They went for citizenship the right way.  We applaud them  very hard working people and super nice and friendly happy to be Americans.
"It was an unfortunate reference ,but Haiti is a crappy country along with many others that's a fact .the point is we don't need more people on our welfare roles."
"Ever been to Arkansas,Missouri ??..more white folks on welfare from Kentucky,West Virginia."
Arturo Robles yes and my point we have enough to help here now we don't need more from anywhere .
He's speaks like a regular joe. He's not HObama that yucks it up according to his audience.
Haiti will thank you when their tourism industry explode$ from all the snowflakes that will be going there for holidays because it is such a beautiful place.
"And really to be perfectly honest, Haiti could be considered a ""sh**hole"" because they were never given the aide that was raised for them to help rebuild after the earthquake...7 YEARS AGO. It's very sad. That's why I am very wary of donating to disaster relief."
"Haiti has long been known for full-blown political corruption and demonic activities out in the open. The people have been â€œrapedâ€ù by their leaders for so many years poverty is rampant and a good life for most will never happen. Then Bill & Hillary Clinton came along..., & stole from them again!"
"Put the media on notice. Announce before every meeting that it will be recorded and released to the public if there are any lies swirling around about the meetings and that legal actions-will be taken. That should stop a lot of this fake news. I for one am fed up with the daily grind of garbage being fed to the public by the liberal, bias, slanted media."
"God is watching u. U can choose to disrespect any human on this planet, but remember, u shall grow feeble , die and go back to the dust without taking a pin of ur wealth, for which u brag about. God be our helper!"
"Yes, God is watching him. And God has chosen many a questionable leader throughout the ages. Read your Bible. God chooses who HE uses and God is never wrong."
Are you saying every leader of every country was chosen by God? What about free will? If God makes all the choices that contradicts the whole point of free will and our responsibilities to make choices about our behavior.
Carol Biophilia Lovell-Saas she said many not all so it shouldnâ€™t need to be clarified if youâ€™d read every word
"He didn't say that, stop believing everything the liberal news say, they hate our President as he calls them out on their lies"
get a life.  the sane people in your country does not care what he says it is what he does.   best politician in the world.
News flash: There is no god.
What's someone in Ghana got to do with it.
So will you
"Vanessa...I said ""to me"". I'm delighted with what he has done and is doing.  It's obvious that you are not but you don't speak for me or the others who voted President Trump into the highest office in the land.  Stop micro managing and get on board the Trump train."
I like the way they were able to behave when you let the cameras in there. Once you take those out they run amuck! Keep doing what your doing!! MAGA!!
Ironic...so a president Trump now gets slammed for telling the truth? By the way I would would like to meet a Hatian that doesnt think the same thing about Haiti
"So sad Mr President that you have to deal with such evil liars. This is what is wrong with our country, when the people we place in power are such crooked evil people. Keep fighting, you have so many people who pray for you and love you."
You said it right from the start.  And were nice enough to not say the Clintons have some responsibility for the conditions in Haiti _Ÿ‡__Ÿ‡_ today after funds were misused by their foundation. It is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere with pretty no resources to export. I'm sure many Haitians agree with you about the condition of there infrastructure.
"""Shithole"" is not the word that the PRESIDENT should be using to describe a poor country.  He is held to a higher standard.  His remark was even topped off with wanting immigration from a mostly white country.  Whats next?  Calling certain parts of our cities a shithole?  When does the line get crossed?  How many disgusting things does this man-child need to say?"
"Maybe, the. UN could move their headquarters out of NYC and move it to Haiti.  They are a country with no natural resources.  They are a country that has great tropical weather with great ocean breezes.  This would make Haiti a great place to host a large international organization like the UN.  This could provide many thousands of jobs and build a solid infrastructure."
"Haitians should be mad at the Clintons for stealing their earthquake relief money and not doing the rebuilding promised, and for trafficking the Haitian children. Trump was making an observation....during his frustration of the immigration & DACA talks.  Rough and frank language is common in high level, stressful negotiations.  And I'm sure Trump has said some choice words during his business talks as well. So what?"
My in law family is from Haiti ...they got less than 10% of the money Clinton foundation collected for them....where did it go?????? It went into Hillary's pocket ...the are still living in some tent cities because that money never got to them to help rebuild ....so don't you asswipes dare believe anything the Democrats say Trump supposedly said until you yourself can find that money
"Amen, Debra."
People would rather The President lie and say every other country in the world is full of sunshine and rainbows. Itâ€™s refreshing to not be fed BS for once. Are some of the things he says offensive (to certain groups?) Yes. Is it ok for him to give his honest opinion on matters and not give you politician speak? 100%.
"Itâ€™s not about saying a country isnâ€™t a dreamland, itâ€™s about saying he doesnâ€™t want people to have the chance to come here from those countries. Moron."
"They shouldn't come here, we can't afford it, we have many problems in case you are unaware. We have to get our Country better, they can work on their own, and that is what they should be doing, not running away."
"Who goes on holiday to Haiti? No one (unless youâ€™re a Clinton whoâ€™s there to loot it).    Why does no one go on holiday to Haiti?    Because itâ€™s a shithole.    People go on holiday to the Dominican Republic because itâ€™s nice.    Same island, different socio-economics.    â€” Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) January 12, 2018"
Haiti wouldn't be as bad as it is today if the Clinton Foundation actually gave Haiti the money they collected but kept for themselves.
Holier than thous are more worried about a simple word than how the Clinton's robbed Haiti !!! Unbelievable !!!
"Dear Mr. President...it does not matter what you say or don't say, what you do or don't do...they will always make it seem the opposite of what you mean or actually said or did.  Keep on keeping on.  You Sir are doing one hellava job...MAGA"
After seeing the news and the scandals about to come out.... there is no trust for the media!!!! Not to mention what happened during the election to sway it the other way... spying on every move Trump and his family made.... Hillary Clinton orchestrated this not to mention others.... treason!!!
"If Haiti had the money the Clintons stole from them, their country would be in better condition. The gentleman who was going to testify about the Clintons taking the money was found dead before he could testify.  You don't testify against Hillary Clinton and see another sunrise."
Dear President Trump. I am sooo fed up with those who are constantly trying to destroy you and your presidency. You are a wonderful leader and will go down as one of the best Presidents EVER. We love you and are behind you. These Democrats are slicing their throats when they degrade  you!
"They are constantly looking to be negative about you. You are doing a lot of good things for the people of this country. Now Haiti has horrible problems. Why? Because they are the Voodoo capital of the world. It's that simple. Who and what you worship counts. The United States is rooted in Christian culture and blesses Israel. The bible clearly says that those that bless Israel shall be blessed. Sin is unfortunately what we all do and some on purpose, but God will always bless those that bless Israel."
John 1: 43-51
"I'll never understand why the hundreds of thousands of people leave those countries if they are potentially good places to live. If those folks put their backs into improving their own countries there would not be an issue. They come here for the free stuff, and to be taken care of, not to flee injustice."
"Truth, as usual hurts!  Some countries are ruled by corrupt officials & people are getting poorer each day while officials live in opulence!!! Visit these countries yourselves & see the truth!!!"
"It's the truth! see the example of Brazil, only corruption, immorality and a state devouring business initiatives that would make the country grow. I hope President Trum makes America great again, everyone wins with it!"
Trump speaks his mind.. I prefer a person who is blatantly frank than those who lie with a straight face.   The only problem is:  They twist his words like he was saying of those countries as ...holes referring to the state not its people. I agree to that!
"Geronima Tomelden Carino , me too!!_Ÿ‘è"
"I don't mind that Trump used a few words.  It proves he's human and like the rest of us.  And.............immigrants, think about it, I know many myself. Which ones do you want living next to you? Those that come over to be Americans, or those that come over to get what they can?"
"We spent the last 8 years with a talker in the Whitehouse. How did that work for us?  So President Trump doesn't always articulate his feelings to the democrats ""standards "" I'll take a doer over a lying talker any day."
"Start recording every meeting Mr. President! And youâ€™re not wrong, Haiti is a poor and troubled country. #TrumpTrain #FakeMedia"
"Hold your ground Mr. President!  No DACA.  Dreamers?  We have our very own American, aka legal, young people that have Dreams also.  Don't give in, build that WALL and send them back, with their parents to wherever they came from."
You should also get ready to go where your parents/grand/great-grand parents came from.
Where did this guy read that being poor and troubled country cannot achieve American dream. Rags to riches is really the American dream.
Too bad the Clintons didn't actually give Haiti the millions of dollars Americans donated to them for Haiti.
"I have been to Haiti on a mission and the people are some of the most hardworking and generous people I've ever known. But, yes, the country is not good to its people and so much of its natural beauty and resources have been destroyed by greed. It's a mess."
"I was in Haiti building a medical clinic and I had different take than you. Uneducated and lazy is what I came away with. It's a nation of beggars,."
"So.....Brook sees hard working people........and Casey sees uneducated and lazy.  Hmmmm...........sounds a lot like the U.S. ---- don't you think???"
"The left always lies, and we all know it,                                          I take it all with a grain of salt."
Just make sure you  let them know first before you record them. Unfortunately it has come to this. Keep your head up and just keep plowing through. We the people have faith in you.
Heâ€™s the PRESIDENT he doesnâ€™t have to tell them they should know that they are being recorded! Also have cameras that you control- tired of demon rats trying to â€œtake downâ€ù the best PRESIDENT that our country has ever had!!!!_Ÿ˜˜_Ÿ˜˜_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
"He doesn't have to let them know, DC is one party does not require 2 party consent."
"Haiti might be very poor and troubled, but hey, at least they have a state of the art childrenâ€™s hospital built by the Clinton foundation with all the donations they took to build it after the earthquake.  _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚"
I googled that and learned that it is still not built and construction is at least two years away.  The Clintons stole most of the money and there is not adequate funding.
"John Roberts i think he was being sarcastic , as its common knowledge that the Clintons stole the money from them !"
I hope he was being sarcastic.
Lol.  Definitely sarcasm.  I thought the 3 laughing faces made that quite obvious _Ÿ‘ç
Are you OK? Clintons stole all Haitian money! 94% have been pocketed by Clintons!
^^^^^^^another person who didn't actually see the smiley's after the OP comment!
"Sarcasm, right??????!!!!!!!!!!!"
At this point recording all your meetings with democrats and libs might be the only way to save you the hassle of tweeting what really was said!  It would also let the nation fully know how unwilling they are to work towards what is best for America and not just their voting base.  Your doing just fine!!!   Thank You for all your doing!!  âù_ï¸è_Ÿ‘ç_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
recording would be useless...Democrats make up everything even more so...outside of the meeting room. Alleged...is a word used mostly by Democrats...So and So said...etc. All lies....
Joseph Soto   I know.  â€œAllegedâ€ù and â€œanonymous sourceâ€ù. Two fall back on phrases they all use.
"Just like you ConservaCUNTS think everything that is true about Trump is FAKE news, ya'll are no better."
Lorrie...Pres. Trump will be voted in again in 2020. 2018 is the year Liberals say they will IMPEACH TRUMP...and INSANITY will be the tool used. It will never happen. Pres. Trump has the Liberal.s so confused they don.t know what to do.
"Look you hit a nerve and hurt miss Lorries feelings.  Name calling and such is pathetic, and it is what you do when you don't have enough brain power to come up with some smart. lol lol"
Where was the outrage on Hillary scamming the Haitians? It's obvious from looking at Haiti now that she didn't mind stealing from the poor either. We deplorables pay very little attention to what the MSM or Democrats say. Their best features are the opposite of honesty. MAGA
"Thank the Clinton's for making Haiti the way it is. They have robbed that country of its natural resources,  used their foundation to laundry money instead of helping Haiti and tried to smuggle little girls out for Lord knows what reason. Once again President Trump is calling attention to the poverty left behind by past administrations that no one wants to talk about."
No their govt corruption is worse than ours but she sure didnâ€™t help!
Hillary and her zionist buddies rob many nation states around the world for their resources. All to serve Israle and Russia. They think their Talmud is above the law. How many countries has Israel destabilized using other people?
funny how words offend so many but actual actions go unnoticed like when the Clintons robbed Haiti blind after the Earthquake.
AMEN!!!!
"Mr. President, did the Dems ever complain about what the Clinton Foundation did to Haiti? I don't remember that, certainly not while they were voting for the very people who are to blame for that country being in such a poor state. Of course you should record interactions with Dems, they are not interested in the welfare of Haiti, not in the least! They're not trustworthy!"
"Haiti is a shithole, just one shithole of the many shitholes in which we import poverty from. No English, no money, no skills...but on the plus side they do bring their diseases with them"
Pathetic isnâ€™t it?
"So, he ""supposedly"" said this in a ""closed-door"" meeting, right?  So leaking info from a closed-door meeting is apparently acceptable now?  ISN'T THAT what we SHOULD be talking about??"
We should be talking about who leaked it
Yup but the evil rats will put their spin on it and don't stop. They're disgusting in every way imaginable.
The American people have every right to know what these elected politicians say behind closed doors. That goes for both parties.
"Ok, then why are the meetings ""closed-door""?  Put them ALL on TV then."
"Typical left... Theyâ€™re focused on a word, (if said at all) instead of the question by the President, Donald J. Trump; which is, WHY do you want to let more of these people into our country?, WHY donâ€™t you strive to invite the best, brightest and those able to benefit this nation? As I said, typical! #MAGA âù_ï¸è_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ’™"
"If people do not know these countries are corrupted, then they should not make any comments.  For years, the situation there has not changed with billions of dollars poured into to help!  Where is the Clinton Foundation who supposed to help Haiti?"
"What's worse?Referring to a 3rd world country as a â€œs***hole,"" or using â€œreliefâ€ù money raised for Haiti to line your pockets? #clintonfoundation #truthhurts"

"Basically nearly everything that's said about Trump by the news has been made up so far, I've been researching everything he 'actually' said and it's never anything like what the newspapers or news say it is..."
"Mr President, Iâ€™m a life time Democrat, but I voted for you and Iâ€™m proud of my vote an what you have done An will do for our country,Thanks"
"Even if you did say it it's not like you're lying! I get that it's a messed up situation for the people in Haiti, but maybe we should hold their government accountable for the way they treat their citizens OR maybe we should hold the Clinton Foundation who embezzled Millions from that country accountable!"
The government and their short-term memory syndrome.  When the election  procedures was going on 2 years ago. The Haitians living here that have been protesting for years because their native country has become a dump. And it has been by the hands of the Clinton's and the Obama Administration. They never wanted to help rebuild  Haiti after the earthquake.  It was all about making the money .  And their government was all for that to. So I'm pretty sure the Haitians feelings are not hurt. They have been screaming for the mountains about this for years.
"I am a Caribbean  immigrant  who voted  for Donald Trump.  I love this country, respect the flag and it's  citizens.  The leaders  in  other countries  should be  held accountable for the  for the  things  they do.  They  collect US  funds and  enrich  themselves.  Thank  you for standing strong."
Unfortunately many of these countries are shitholes.. created by corrupt governments.. we voted for Trump to prevent our country from joining those ranks.. if you all dont think our government was corrupt..look at what we faced the last 10 yrs!.. finally things are turning around for all of us.. our diverse citizens are finally rising up.. we the people put in someone who puts us first!!!..
Exactly
Never trust the Dems! They will stab you President in the back no matter what you do or say. Dont fall for their promises because they always bail out and do not keep them. We've learned this years ago !
That's why we CANNOT compromise on immigration! The left will use it!!  NO AMNESTY!!
or rinos
some will never learn
"You can say sh*hole Mr President.  Iâ€™ve been there, sh*hole is a very accurate description and probably the most accurate one Iâ€™ve heard yet of the country in the media.   Since when have you been ashamed to speak the truth?"
They don't make the democrats answer about the foreign aid to Hatti that Hillary Clinton was responsible for that never went to the people of Hatti.. but they got a problem with grown up conversations that deal in truth. Go Trump...
"To be honest, If they arenâ€™t sh!thole countries (not the people, but the countries) why would people be leaving in droves? #makingamountainoutofamolehill #mediaignorance  #msm #WishWeStillHadRealJournalists"
"Mr. President, I served in Haiti, 94 and 95 while assigned to the 10th Mountain Division.  I was stationed in Cap Haitian, Sir, with all due respect, Haiti is a shithole.  Although, now not sure why, the Clinton Foundation supposedly spent millions after the earthquake to clean it up...."
So Hillary could funnel the money through her foundation and give the Haitians nothing
"Seems like the president is smeared with everything the clintons did, such as Russia collusion, Hillary's mental illness, Haiti, you name it. The President is not a scapegoat for the losers who want to destroy our country!"
zionist clintons whom work with Marxist Communist Russia
Maybe the Democrats should investigate the Clintonâ€™s interactions with Haiti.

"John Corleone, FB is also marking this post from our great POTUS as ""spam"" and have prevented me from sending it.  Fascist FB ""censorship"" is over the top.  If it were in favor of the libturds, it would be okay."
Liz Angela it certainly would
I'd guess any clear thinking person already knows the democrats will spin what you say to something to suit their agenda. That's why you must keep tweeting! #MAGA
The U.S. has sent billions of $$â€™s in aid to Haiti over the years for disasters that had occurred in that country and their government just stole the money rather rebuild their country. Yes itâ€™s a shithole.
Thank you for this clarification. I knew when I read reportedly to ignore the report. We are getting smart in deciphering msm. Maybe they wanted a chance at getting nominated for the fake new award.
Smh
They will not succeed.  MSM wants to hurt the Presidency. Everybody knows it would be about the condition and the neglect of  their own countries. Never the skin color of the people. The left needs to wake up!
"DACA- Congress is talking about how many people who barely speak English and will be on government subsidies when they enter the country, while on the other hand NO ONE says a word when some in congress are talking about reducing Social Security and Medicare for US citizens! What is wrong with people that we put in Washington to be advocates for fairness to American citizens?"
Criminal is what it should be.
Maybe they can shed some light on the $80 million the Clinton's Foundation allotted to Haiti which only got $8 million of that.  Ask the native not the Politicians there.
the hate and fake news would never cover this
"Consider this : Whoever leaked this comment committed a Federal Offense. if ""Guilty Hillary"" was President- she would have handed them their suicide note and they would be ""room temperature"" before leaving the property... What happened to the Clinton Foundation $$$ to rebuild Haiti- they had Million$ to inve$t and rebuild-where'$ the laundered Haiti $$$ ""Guilty Hillary"" ? Democrats wanna go there- We're there- Where is the $$$ ? Flip this on Hillary."
"One thing I want to say , Remember the Clintons and their friends embezzled US taxpayers relief money going to Haiti after suffering a massive earthquake.. those poor people are still suffering today.. Ask any Haitian you come across.. They never recovered"
They are still living in tents thanks to the Clintonâ€™s stealing all the donations made to this country. HOW can they sleep at night????knowing they kept the money instead of helping these poor people.
zionist clinton agenda. Her daughter got married in Israel
Saying what is true ~ these countries do have many issues. We need to be upfront about this! It is just wasting time walking on eggshells to deliberate about that. That is why many of us esteem you. ~~You say what is what! ~~  And you Get the job done! Do not worry! Stay healthy!...You are in the Prayers of many Americans. Thank you and Godspeed!
What is wrong with you? You trump people are unbelievable the way you just keep defending this moron. Geezus
MAGA..  He told the truth ..
They're just trying to cover up and turn attention away from the fact that the Clintons pocketed all the donations for Haiti.
YESS!  You got it Kristi!
I agree!
Agree 100%!
"It was reported that Haiti got $712 million in relief from the US for the Earthquake...also that the Clintons stole most of it...and what is really amazing is that there are only 11,000 Haitians there...like a small town...how ridiculous that they are in the mess they are in."
"Haiti is the poorest, most corrupt country in the Western Hemisphere.  You think it's bad because the 3% have most of the money here in the states?  Down there, .0001% have 99% of the money.  You get outside Port Au Prince, and those people are pulling clothes off dead bodies to have something to wear."
"When I was in the Dominican Republic about 4 years ago, I asked about tours that would go to the border -- just the Haitian border, not into Haiti. I was told that there are no tours that do that because it's not considered to be safe, and that I should not trust anyone who might offer to take me there.Furthermore, Haiti is the country that had tremendous damage from an earthquake because none of the buildings, including five star hotels where American politicians had stayed while visiting the country, were up to any kind of code. The buildings collapsed like matchsticks. I looked at the island on Google Earth shortly after the earthquake, and the border between the Haiti and the Dominican Republic showed a sharp distinction between wreckage and buildings that survived the earthquake. Since then, Haiti has been further raped by charities that do more harm than good, i.e., the Clinton Foundation."
it's OK America doesn't need to be the welfare hub of the world. 20 trillion in debt and our debt is in China's hand its a recipe for disaster. our debt to gdp is at a critical level screw the bleeding heart liberals. they think they have a lock on the non white vote and that's all immigration is to them
The shame of it all is that it has worked for them that's why they are trying and crying so hard about borders and immigration! What a shame!
"Haiti is in desperate need, left in that condition by Hillary not giving the millions of dollars collected for them but she did set her brother up with permits to be involved with the Haitian gold mines!"
Ever been to Haiti?  If is and will always be a ShitHole.  No amount of $$ will turn it around; most of it gets stolen anyhow.
"America can't fix every country. The people and the governments of troubled and poor countries need to fix their own countries. America can only do so much to help, without taking away from American people. If the governments are holding back on their people, it's up to the people of those countries to set things right, not America."
America cant support the whole world! When r other countries goin to step up to the plate and help these poor people? Nobody will help this country if we r ever n a crisis!
"Funny there are countries I would never in a million years visit. Haiti is one of them, North Korea is another.  Their governments are so corrupt, and their people are so down trodden, it truly is a S------e.  As for whether President Trump said this I would say no, doesn't sound like a typical comment. I would definitely believe that the Dems took something said and elaborated and embellished it before coming out and spewing their hatred for the President all over the place."
"Don't bleep it, say it... SHITHOLE... if I can say it, you can too. Teach to your kids and grandkids. Yours Truly, Mr. TRUMP."
"Yep, totally impossible the guy who said â€˜grab them by the pussyâ€™, could also utter the word â€˜shitholeâ€™."
"Funny that no one has mentioned that a great part of the country is in ruins because of the 'aid' that came to them through the Clinton Foundation. Friends of mine that have gone on mission trips there can tell some gruesome stories about the governments exploitation of children for profit, as well as the justified hatred that the common people of Haiti have for the Clinton's.  They trusted the Clinton's, the Clinton Foundation screwed them and NOW this administration is supposed to FIX it?  I don't think so - fix your corrupt government, tell your new government to go after the funds that were supposed to make your country whole again then get to work."
"If so many people want to complain about this, they can jump on a plane to Haiti and quit slinging mud. Honestly I don't see how some of the people in this country are allowed to vote when they have the maturity of a 5 year old. It's disgusting."
The people who live in these countries want to escape because of the corruption.  Why don't these congressmen visit these countries. Do they go there for vacation??? I don't think so.  Just like they won't go to the border...Trump has gone to our border with Mexico.
"I have lived in El Paso, Texas for many years and I have yet to see congress come here to see what's going on or to talk with the people guarding our border, yet the just critisize what they do not know!"
zionist Trump only cares about securing Israel and Russia.
Victoria A. Deobald Trump doesn't care about Russia and niether do I.. you are showing how uninformed you are
"Victoria A. Deobald troll, snowflake, minion. go back to mommy and daddys cellar. need your safe space now I imagine."
Haiti wouldn't be in such poor shape of Crooked Hillary and her husband hadn't stolen and made off with all there AID money _Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ˜¡
"I'm Haitian. You might never understand it but I'm proud. The ""shithole"" country you're talking about took down the slavery system, my ""shithole"" grandparents fought in Savanah for your independence. From your alternative galaxy to the real world Mister President, i just wanna let you know that I'm a proud ""shithole"" citizen and this is not the America that I know.Haiti will rise again."
"The President is right!  Haiti is the most impoverished country in Latin America and the country most affected by TB and HIV/AIDS in the region, with a prevalence of the latter in adults of up to 6% (UNAIDS, 2002).https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1326436/"
Toni..learn geography..Haiti is in the Caribbean..Not a Latin American country.
"We all know exactly what Potus meant regardless of how he worded it. Third world countries are â€œ crapholes â€œ !!!!! Those people are No good for America     Call me what you want, but the truth will stand when the world falls !!!"
I'll call you what you are as well as trump. You're both RACISTS!
Cindy McGrady your desperate.
"I'll call you what you both are too, Racists!  You are disgusting people.  You do realise that your ancestors left their Crap hole country to go and make a better life for themselves, dont you?  Or does the History of the USA mean nothing to you?  People dont immigrate because they have a great life in the country they live in, they immigrate to have a chance at a better life.  I with the Native Americans would have told your family to go back to the shithole it came from.  You are a disgusting, bigoted and nasty person."
"More than 90 percent of recent refugees from Middle Eastern nations are on food stamps and nearly 70 percent receive cash assistance, according to government data.  This goes for other refugees as well.  Our ancestors had no assistance."
Marina Brozovic that was then... this is now.
Diane Lapinski thank you
Marina Brozovic my ancestors came from England. Hoo Rah _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
The problem is the US and other countries give billions to countries such as Haiti and there is never any improvements.  It stays the same without any real solution...throwing money out the window.  How can we help them become self-sustaining????
"Go after the Clintons for stealing the money that was raised for Haiti!  If you could find the money, the country would still be a shithole.  Why do you think that they want to come here??"
"zionist clintons must be held accountable. Also,  ""investigate her for blowing away the American people's health care funds as secretary of state"".-Hitchens"
"Reducing the population in Haiti would be a good thing.  It would improve their quality of life.  Forget the skin color, race, nationality, etc.  Just focus on the quality.  The children in that country deserve a better life.  Socialism doesn't work & neither does politicizing the issue."
"I didn't hear any Democrats outrage when the Clinton foundation raised money for Haiti and none or very little of the money made it to them. As for Nigeria, this country is way to tribal to allow mass immigration. If they are not fighting themselves they are torn apart by some other form of terror trying to take over. Not to mention the disease that will come over with their poorest of poor."
"Probably a good idea to record all meetings. And yes Haiti is a very hard place to live, proof is people attempting an ocean crossing with literally anything that MIGHT float just to escape that nation."
"The common wisdom has it that the derogatory adjective you uttered concerning Haiti was â€œshitholeâ€ù, while also saying that applies to El Salvador and various African nations countries. That's so uncool and unpresidential! Whatever purpose could it serve saying that about Haiti and El Salvador?"
Meanwhile the dems use the f word like a mantra and nobody dares to criticize them. Who cares what he says as long as he does the job he was ELECTED to do.
"Mr. President, perhaps we could arrange a deal where Haiti helps us build the F-52s we sell to Norway?"
Fifty-two F-35s. He made a blunder in his speech; big deal...not.
The man is a walking blunder with the intelligence of an unpopped zit.
Call the countries what they are and demand change. Their leaders need to be held accountable for the conditions of their country.  Hillary Clinton did far worse to Haiti
Hillary's zionist agenda must be stopped for her buddy Putin
You dont have to explain yourself....Democrats are low life globalist dirt bags that want to keep the status quo until we have global socialism
"What a shame that you have a private meeting with all of your top AIDS, and people cannot wait to go outside those doors and blab what was said or what may have been said that was off color. No trust at all in this country anymore, and absolutely no respect or consideration for top officials who are trying to better this country"
"Maybe the governmentâ€™s of the countries mentioned should stop stealing and corruption, build decent societies , build education and improve the lives of their citizens. How unique!"
"There is nothing wrong with wanting to bring skilled labor into the country rather than a dependent class of people.  We need to expand the working sector, not the welfare sector.  This has nothing to do with race, and we all know it."
"I believe in you, President Trump!  You are a man of integrity with a very good heart, and only good will toward your fellow man.  Thank you for putting our country first as our president. You are doing exactly as you should.  Don't ever give up being the man you are.  Thank you with all my heart!!!"
We have a friend that's a teacher in Haiti as a missionary and has been there for over 25 years she told us they don't have running water in the school they don't have inside toilets the material they have to use is very inadequate to teach children so were does all the money go to the Rich and Famous????
Ask Bill & Hillary that question!
Probably government thieves.
"I knew you didnâ€™t say it in the way the cbs news is stating. Donâ€™t worry, the majority of Americans knows the truth!  Youâ€™re doing a superb job Mr. President! Just keep the trump train chugging along!  Youâ€™ll go down in history sir as one of the best presidents ever!! You are making history and the the dems donâ€™t like all the good you are accomplishing for our beautiful America, and you are putting the dems to shame.   They are grasping and making up any negative story they can. We pray for you and your family_Ÿ™èâù_ï¸è"
zionist owned media
What happened to Clinton Foundation promised money for Haiti after last devastating hurricane?  Never was donated!  Haiti is still a mess.
Earth quake
"Yes, thank you for correction Joan.  So sad there hasn't been any improvement in these people's lives."
How can a people trust if they've only ever been abused?! Get rid of the Clintons! Take the Clintons stolen money and give it back to Haiti and help them rebuild for their people not for the investors! You want to see change? Real change in the world? Give it back to the people!
Clinton robbed Haiti and America for her zionist buddies. Putin should be investigated to as Marxist Communists are funded by the zionists
"I don't care what you may have said or didn't say about Haiti, I want to hear you say on national television that you have a submitted a Term Limits bill to Congress for Congress."
You would have to vote out a majority of Congress to get this passed. I donâ€™t see that happening.
"Rather than bringing  Haitians in we ought to send Americans especially  religious to the country to open their eyes and talk to them that voodoo is not working for them.  As a Catholic, this is where firm support is needed to separate faith from endearing or cultivating cultural beliefs  where they go contrary to the teachings of Christ."
I lived among lots of Haitans in South Florida. Legend has it the Haitans made a pact w/ the devil to keep their country when the French were at war w/ them. They have been suffering since.
Oh my Lord!  Have mercy on us!
"Unlike the ""Clinton foundation"" who stole 20 million dollars to help the Haiti people....instead their daughter had a 20 million dollar wedding. Real nice Hu but at least they can be called $hitholes."
"thank you president trump for clearing that up, we already know the dems. lie about you and the media piddle paddles right behind the dems. Your doing a great job."
Governments of these extremely poor nations are corrupt & care nothing about their people letting them starve & go without essentials while the government officials live well off. When aid is given to these countries there must be a way to oversee it & not let the aid fall into corrupt hands.
"Well, some countries are shitholes, the difference between those that will and those that won't is called the truth and being a realist, instead of living in make believe land where everything is perfect everywhere all the time. And I don't think he said that anyway, but if he did,,,,,,,, who TF cares!"
"Here is a DIRECT QUOTE right from Trumps mouth.On Hillary Clinton and Haiti:""It takes a village, you should know, you've taken several!""."
bahahahaha!!!  Exactly!!!
"I wonder what Haiti would be like if the Clinton Foundation hadnâ€™t STOLEN their donation money. Probably the same, because if they had handed it over, Haitiâ€™s crooked officials would have kept the money."
"zionist clintons whom work for Israel. ""As secretary of state she blew away America's health care funds"". Hitchens"
But your so right Mr Trump. If we gonna have ppl from foreign countries let it be ppl that will work and make a difference in our country. Not ppl that will arrive and immediately get on government assistance and stay on assistance for generations to come.
Cara de pendejo
"It seems to me that the problem with these countries is that those who come here have no ability to assemilate.  They seem to band together and create the same **country they came from.  Of course the politicians they support, love the easily convinced, just by protecting the promises of freebies."
"Seeing that most states that are dominantly republican also come to this predicament, this statement is hilarious."
We believe in you! The liberals have continuously show us they are liars! If it was 2 PM in the afternoon  and a liberal said the sun is shinning I would have to look outside to confirm that statement before I would believe it!
"I know, right? Some unnamed ""someone"" says that they heard another unnamed ""someone"" say that they heard President Trump say [fill in the blank] and the media treats it like it's actual news. So tired of this. Let CNN just admit that they made it up for ratings."
"Of course you canâ€™t trust Democrats. Theyâ€™ve been giving our country away for decades, lying, stealing, and turning on us, THE PEOPLE. Why would you give them an ounce of trust??? _Ÿ‘__Ÿè__Ÿ˜_"
Doesn't Hillary have Haiti's money? Pretty sure she and Bill took off with it. ;)
Fake outrage from the same losers who let Clintons steal Haiti relief fund and steal the children...they are gross _Ÿ’¯âœ”âè°â˜__Ÿ‘_
TRUE
"It is a shame that itâ€™s come to having to record yourself. I donâ€™t know how you face these haters every single day, but I thank God that you do. Youâ€™re an inspiration beyond any I have seen. Please stay strong! _Ÿ™è MAGA"
You are a pathetic liar! Not a very good one at that. We should take you out! Please do record future meetings. We will use them in your impeachment  hearings.
Ha ha ha ha TRUMP 2020
"What was/is your opinion of barack obama , aka., barry soetoro , aka., thru ss# harrison j bounel ??"
"So I guess your yearly vacation is to Haitian country or Africa? I didnâ€™t think so, youâ€™re more of a Florida guy, right?"
"You prefer people who are not honest enough to run under their own names like Barack Obama and Bill Clinton?  Trump not only uses his own name but he tells it like it is. Robb, have you booked your next vacation to Haiti?"
Sorry Robb if Clinton or Obama werenâ€™t impeached Trump never will. Grow up Hillary lost
Get over it snowflake!  You lost!
Ada Brown Campbell What country did your ancestors come from? Are you native American? Otherwise we are all immigrants.
"Craig Mason Clinton probably would be impeached in todayâ€™s climate. Obama never did anything impeachable. Miller will probably have enough substantial evidence to not only impeach Trump, but to put him in prison as well."
Robb Evans Trump likes immigrants just not illegal or immigrants that will drain our welfare system. Personally I would like to have my social security when I retire rather than supporting a bunch of welfare leaches AKA lifetime Democrats..
Joseph Soto yes! Trump for prison 2020!
Shitholes
"What happened to all that money that was raised for Haitians and put in a trust for them?  Clinton Foundation, or something I think it was called?"
The Clinton Crime Syndicate stole and laundered to their personal accounts.  Hitlery's brothers also confiscated the only working gold mine in Haiti and stole the wealth.
"You're in good company Mr. Trump; recall what the great Senator Kennedy said:  "" Contrary to the charges in some quarters, [the bill] will not inundate America with immigrants from any one country or area, or the most populated and deprived nations of Africa and Asiaâ€_"""
"It doesn't matter to me , what you said or didn't say. I didn't elect a saint or a goody two shoes for President.  You spared me and America a Hillary Clinton Presidency, for that I am forever grateful."
"Haiti will never be a ""better place"".  It's not in their DNA to make it a better place.  Until an end is put to the corruption that runs rampant within the social elite and companies willing to invest in the economy can do so without paying homage to those in power, the gaps between the social elite and the people living in squalor will rival only the distance from the Earth to the Moon."
"No need to apologize. Countries like Haiti, Mexico, and many other of the countries south of the border are for lack of better words... Sh**Holes. If they were not, the citizens of those countries wouldn't be stepping all over themselves to come here legally, and ILLEGALLY. Sorry, but sometimes the truth hurts."
If someone says Syria is a shithole country it's not an attack on the people. Syria is a shithole country which is why a lot of those people would love to move to a freeer country given the opportunity.
"The Clintom Foundation diverted the monies earmarked for Haiti's recovery after the devastaing earthquake to their own personal use.  I understand that Chelsey's wedding was paid for (all 3.5 million) in such manner.  As a long-standing devotee of Haiti and its people, and a contributor through Catholic Relief Services, I find it beyond hypocritical that the Lefties accuse the Right of not caring, not sharing, not loving."
"I got bad news for you, right now Puerto Rico and Haiti look pretty much the same.  Maybe we should work harder cleaning up our own shitholes before tweeting about others."
Omg thank you for having common sense! Seems no one else commenting can take the presidents dick out their mouth long enough to say something intelligent
"The problem with Trump is, it is so easy to make jokes about his behavior, instead of addressing his pathology.  That's the biggest failing of our media, they laugh while the world burns.  He is simply a horror show of a human being, who only knows how to make himself feel big by tearing the rest of us down.  He maybe my president, but he does not represent me, and slowly but surely the people who support him will get burned.  Carrier employees will attest to that."
"In America if you get struck by a car, someone calls 911, people rush to your side until the ambulance arrives, and transports you to a hospital, while your church takes food to your home for two weeks...In Haiti, when you get hit by a car, you get hit by another car, then another, and another, and another, and another...Oh sorry, I meant the same car since they only have one car in Haiti, thanks to the Clintons..."
"President Trump, please go on the offense. Create a Task Force to remake Haiti into paradise, funding this project with funds diverted from the UN. Shame  your detractors, including the Bushes and Clintons who got the publicity from Haiti and never delivered! God bless you, Mr. President, may He protect and guide you. Amen."
"It's OK for Democrats to make things up about a presidential candidate and the residing president. But it's not OK for the president to talk about other country's obvious issues? America get your priorities straight, it's America first. If you want to make Haiti first, go to Haiti. If you want to make Mexico first go back to Mexico. Get it?"
"Some of these countries are exactly what president Trump described them as. No law, no government, horrible poverty. We have enough problems in our country that need to be taken care of and the last thing we need are more immigrants coming in to cause problems and crime.  But remember Hillary Clinton wanted to have lots and lots and lots of immigrants coming into this country. I am proud to be a deplorable and proud the Donald Trump is our president."
It's clear that you are passionate about immigration and the safety of our country. You didn't say it about the people. as usual they pounce on every word you say. Haiti would be better today if clintons hadn't robbed them blind. Clintons should be ordered to restore all that money they took from Haiti.
"Iâ€™m gonna be honest. I donâ€™t care if thatâ€™s what he said or not. If he did he isnâ€™t wrong. Isnâ€™t that why the citizens of those countries come here? For a better life? To live the American Dream? I donâ€™t hear anyone saying Iâ€™m gonna go live the Haitian dream. Do you?No DACA deal! Build the wall!!"
Right now thousands of Haitians are fleeing their country because of bad leadership in the Haitian government. I have pics.
"Right now thousands of U.S. service men and women are serving in Africa a place he also called a s**thole. Brilliant President, putting all there lives at risk with his ignorant comments."
"Rebecca Godek Sometimes the truth hurts, yet it's still the truth! We need to assist those countries, not bring all their people here, who the hell is going to help rebuild their country, if not them! We're not responsible to fix, repair, build and support every country, it's simply impossible as there's no end!"
Rebecca Godek LBJ said worst things a bout blacks. He was part your the Democrat party.
We are the ones that are a troubled country because we have a leader who lies about his lies. Shithole or not you need to resign. We have no confidence and no trust in you. Sad.
Are you stupid or retarded???
Laura M Colon poor dear you must be really frightened
Met a Haitian taxi driver recently in Florida.  Wish I could remember his name.  Iâ€™m sure heâ€™d tell the Democrats what he told me. He said Haiti was corrupt and no matter how much money is poured into the country the corrupt government will waste it. He said he loves America and never wants to be a citizen of a place like Haiti again! Why do people keep questioning our president when he states the obvious?
"Haiti is not a poor country. It is rich. The other countries help HaÃ¯ti to become poor with their bad international politics. Please, a litle history about the haitian help you to understand. They are a big nation."
"IF he did say it, How many people can say they haven't thought the same thing especially, if you've ever visited the Good side of the Islands for Vacations.."
"Yes, we believe you, youâ€™ve never said anything like that about any country.Sincerely: a rapist and bad hombre"
"Honestly I would love to see the economic ROI of bringing in immigrants from countries with lack luster education systems and poor governments. From what I have gathered, the vast majority of immigrants from these 3rd world countries do not provide a net benefit in terms of business creation, taxes or advancing GDP. They generally have too many children (per their culture) and work near poverty level for generations. Shouldn't we want a period of bringing in only the best and brightest to this country? We have tried the other way for generations and now look at the poverty rate, shrinking middle class and competition from strict immigration countries like China. You can't have a stagnant economy outpaced by a growing welfare class and expect to be #1."
Liar..is that kind of like Mexico paying for the wall and your willingness to release your taxes if elected!? Thatâ€™s on tape EVERYWHERE.
Sherry you been drinking that bad water haven't you?
Noâ€”apparently you haveâ€”if you are denying he said Mexico would pay for the wall and that he would release his taxesâ€”please keep drinking the kool aideâ€”your not living in reality
"who cares if mexico is paying for the wall or not , and who cares about his taxes,  and for Haiti it is a shithole !"
Thanks my family does missionary work and adopted a child from Haitiâ€”go burn a cross
I care that Mexico is paying for the wall and Trump shows his taxesâ€”AS PROMISED BY HIM.  Donâ€™t tell me how other politicians have liedâ€”and thatâ€™s why you voted for himâ€”he is not telling the truthâ€”but you excuse him anyway. It was NEVER about the lying was it? It was about something else.
I donâ€™t have to answer your question Williamâ€”but yes I didâ€”
It is Obamaâ€”you want respect for Trump show respect for othersâ€”ignorant man
Sherry Hon who was your choice for president ?
"Sherry Hon  The ""basement dwellers"" had their say when they elected him. That name calling is on tape also. Just accept that no one, not even the president ""has"" to show others their taxes. How often do you bring out your returns at family gatherings?? Have you shown them to all your neighbors??"
"Who was your choice Tim? What if I told you Trump?"
MaryAnn D Mazur -every President has since Dwight Eisenhowerâ€”and that is not the pointâ€”it was what he said he would doâ€”what HE SAID. Itâ€™s about integrity.
Basement dwellersâ€”how offensive
"Sherry Hon Ah, yes, you're one of the perpetually offended."
Noâ€”I just believe in decency and civility
Even if he did or didn't mention Haiti it's still a cesspool. I sure in the heck wouldn't move there !!! Fixing World poverty and over population is not America's responsibility.
"I have a dear friend who lives in Miami. He came from Haiti as a refugee, during the Duvalier regime in the late 70ths , with wife and 2 children. First he got a job, then his green card, then his American citizenship.  He put his kids through school, then college. His daughter is a pediatric doctor. He eventually remarried and has 2 more children. He just turned 77 and is still working, with no desire to stop. He has never been unemployed - and he voted for Trump, and will do it again."
"Yes, President Trump, do record meetings in the future.  This is as close to a time of â€œno trustâ€ù as I ever want to see in our country and society.  We need you to continue fulfilling your promises to the people for the full 8 years.  Record meetings and whatever else you need to do to have proof of the words spoken and in context."
"I don't care what my President said or did not say. If Haiti were a great country vs a craphole country, Haitians would be flocking back to it instead of trying desperately to never go back.  The truth is not always pretty, eloquent or politically correct, but yet still the truth."
Exactly
"Haitianos, cubanos, brasileiros, venezuelanos, latinos, muÃ§ulmanos deveriam ficar em seu paÃ_s e nÃ£o perturbar o paÃ_s dos outros. Sou brasileira, meu paÃ_s Ã© um mar de corrupÃ§Ã£o Onde falta tudo e a impunidade Ã© a lei. Mas jamais deixo meu paÃ_s pois penso que EUA sÃ£o para americanos. Grande parte dos bandidos que temos aqui sÃ£o estrangeiros e o Brasil acolhe pois sÃ£o da paz. Presidente Trump mande uma bomba para cÃ¡ por favor."
"I agree with you - the countries you refer to are truly shithole countries!  Perhaps the Dems should remember that Haiti might well be a little more productive had all those millions & millions of dollars that were donated to the Haitians years ago through the Clinton Foundation actually found their wait to Haiti.  Instead all but $25,000 went into the Clinton's pockets.  How quickly one forgets!!"
"Dems, liberal, and the media have been caught lying so many times we no longer believe anything they say. Keep doing what you are doing! Dems have shown that they will do anything, tear this country apart, just to gain control. I will NEVER vote Dem! They have shown their true character."
Corruption in Haiti learned from the Clintons. Bloomfield Hills Michigan we would collect school supplies (1000's of $$) and stop in Haiti to deliver.  The police would confiscate them and sell them. It's hard to help people with so much corruption around them. The other side of the mountain they are doing much better.
"Whether you did or not, Haiti is a shithole, plain and simple. Could be worse, you could have stolen many millions from their disaster fund."
Yet the media never talks about THAT! Or Uranium 1! Interesting isnâ€™t it?
"To the millions of men and women from all countries who have built with their hands, with their intelligence and with their hearts the greatest nation in the world, America has not said, ""Come, and all you will be given. America has said, ""Come, and there will be no other limit to what you can accomplish than your courage and your talent."" The America we love around the world is this country that has this extraordinary ability to give everyone a new chance, because in America, failure is never final. #MAGA"
Missed a chance to remind the country of the leeches the Clintons are and what they personally have done to the country.  Couldnt have sucked the people of Haiti dryer in every possible way.....BTW how is Tony Rodham doing back at the gold mine in Haiti?
"Really?  You're going to lie about this now? People in your own party say you said it.  Your press office didn't dispute it.  Who are you trying to convince?  60% of the country already knew you're an awful person, and the 30 something percent that like you like that you say inflammatory crap like this."
"The Clintons are the ones that really hate the Haitians; they only gave $40,000 out of the 11 million their foundation collected for them...And was praised by the Democrats for doing it, I might add..."
"Yeah Terrance, what did happen to all that money????/"
"Joe Medlin Most likely in an off-shore account somewhere, maybe even laundered in Russia...as part of the uranium deal...Or in a vault on Jekyll Island...Now I'll probably be mysteriously murdered like 43 others for just saying this..."
Joe Medlin Inquiring minds want to know.
"It is a sad state of affairs when you have to resort to recording all of your meetings.  The fake media and the bleeding heart lliberals are determined to turn America into a Socialist and then a Communist country.  Stick to your guns, President Trump!  MAGA!"
"dude, just because your followers/base/uneducated (30%) believe anything that comes out of your mouth does not make those words trueyou are attempting to gaslight the people of this country, it's not gonna work....70% of us are not going to fall for it"
"It's a shame you have cancelled your UK visit. Do not let our career politicians damage our special relationship, you and Nigel Farage have brought back the power of nation state democracy from the global establishment; keep up the good work!"
"I realize their are good people everywhere, even in shitholes.  But let us not forget that many of these places are in the condition theyâ€™re in because of their customs, lifestyles, beliefs, etc.  I remember when our country was providing birth control for Haitians.  The men refused to use condoms because it took away from their pleasure.  And it seems like they like a variety of pleasure very often.  During the height of the AIDS epidemic it was believed it started in Haiti.  Personally, I believe it has been around much longer than that, but the Haitians sexual habits definitely were a great breeding ground for such a disease."
So true!! I lived among lots of them in South Florida. They took over bcuz they breed like mice. Legend has it they made a pact w/ the devil to keep their country in a war w/ the French. They have been suffering ever since. Even when they have everything in the USA alot of them aren't nice people.
"Anyone here going on vacation have Haiti, Somalia, etc on their Top 10 Destinations wish list? Didn't think so...I don't care if he said it or not. It's a truth that many think ...Haiti is back in the headlines, instead of whatever inane topic was there until yesterday.Good for PDJT.Perhaps we can find where The Clinton Foundation Aid for Haiti funds were directed?I âù_ï¸èâù_ï¸èâù_ï¸è my President!"
"I wonder about people who say they ""love"" Trump; I mean, it's obvious they view the concept of ""love"" as cheap."
"Liberalism is a mental disorder full of lies and deceit, hate and blame, ignorance, violence, and a blatant disrespect of law and order. It does not belong in our government nor our schools. Vote them the hell out _Ÿ‘‰_Ÿè»everywhere _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸ #MAGA"
Hey ignorance that will NEVER happen!! HAHAHAHAHAHA.
Lorrie Janine and youre just ignorant_Ÿ˜‚ Enjoy 4+ more years of #MAGA
No one has said anything.on how the Clintons stole MILLIONS from donations that were suppose to help Haiti.
"Crocodile tears from the media.  False outrage from the democrats, seeking empathy with purported hurt feelings in the African American and Haitian communities, in a quest for votes.  I do not believe he said what Durbin accused him of saying in that context.  Let's face it, Haiti has been a poor and troubled country ever since the reign of Papa Doc Duvalier.  Add the recent financial rape by the Clintons."
Dont care if you did. America dont want more people from these countries.  There is no reason to keep bring more people into this country.  Its not 1901 any more.  Only people that should be coming here are the ones that can pay their own way.
Pehaps the Haitians should go back and work on improving their own country.  They have been here long enough.  When you are right--you are right.
"If Dems or CNN so cared about Nigeria or Haitians, let them take there rich friends to Africa or Haiti for more investment to create more jobs and development. CNN should stop using black for American politics, if Hilary was to be black woman, and Trump calls her crooked heaven will have fallen."
"Normal people understand what you say. Those filled with hate, love to hate and twist whatever you say. Its disgusting how many want that OWG. I hope they NEVER get so close to changing us again.  ONLY some  of the rich or ignorant want a Socialist government."
Funny that you didnâ€™t deny saying anything derogatory  about African countries or El Salvador. The lies show themselves
"The Dems picked Haiti to deflect the fact Hillary stole the money that was donated that was suppose to go to Haiti for relief.   Sorta like the Russian story, total projection on their part.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out the game."
"The MSM will focus on the most ""insignificant"" things . . . When the meeting was shown on live tv, you know in who's court the ball was bounced. When supposed ""adults"" act like ""scarecrows searching for a brain"" (sorry, I didn't mean to insult scarecrows) it really says something. The fact that these people can't negotiate a meaningful deal and only produce infantile scribbles is incomprehensible. This country has so much potential to do great things here at home and become the beacon of example for other countries. . . but the global elite can't stand to not have their way. Furthermore, ""let those without sin, cast the first stone"" . . ."
"We have helped Haiti for the last 17 years.  We can not help  foreigners continually and not help our vets, etc.   I'm sure there's a way to donate to Haiti if you're serious about helping them so go donate individually or corporately and stop complaining!"
"What people dont know is that while Trump was a private citizen, he took money out of his own pocket, sent Drs Like R. Paul over there to assist with health care....all the while The clintons and Soros were raping the country and selling of the children of Haiti. Trump has done many things like this...he just never bragged about it."
"Tonya Bennett Whitten. Thanks for sharing this with me. I really appreciate it. You're absolutely right. He has done lots of things that haven't made it into the news. He did it private. With no press. I pray for him, his family and administration as God leads me. Keep up the great work you are doing. Don't be discouraged! Don't give up! Never surrender! Stay strong! Make it an absolutely spectacular day. _Ÿ˜_"
"Haiti is here, in america, near you mr. Donald. its true we are poor but its by your country too, united states said all is for and by america, what does U.S do for Haiti? close your morth about, caure we`re the first black people who had made history, remenber we`re helped you to fight, not anypeople!"
Haiti has always been a poor suffering country.full of corruption. It has not changed. Send evrrything there. Many are cayholics. The pope needs to do more for these people. No 1corruption. There must b some good citizens. Use them. Work on it. Do notaccrpt corruption by death penalty f nevessary. Only way to bring up the people.
"It only became poor after they massacred all the white residents. They demanded a country without whites, even bayoneted white babies. Leave them to it. They never deserved a penny."
Remember the earthquakes and the cry for money all over tv????? And the scandal of how much actually went to Haitans at the time yea me too....who was president again? An why is Haiti still in so much poverty what was the president of Haiti said oh ya something like our country's damage was equal to 15 days of bombing....oh ya and what big charity is still thriving off of donations to day yea REd Cross...hmmm people do your research....barely any money made it to them considering how many were donating to that cause.
"Haiti was and is a very poor and backward country thanks to their leaders, the same with Central American Countries, ruled by corrupt and greedy rulers, we can say the same about some Arabs and So. Americans  governments,  and to think the number of natural resources available to their citizens if the foreign countries would take their hands off it, it brakes my heart_Ÿ‡®_Ÿ‡±ï¸è_Ÿ˜ç"
Yes!  Please do record your meetings.  And keep tweeting!  Youâ€™ll make the midterms of 2018 so much easier.
You people should read tbe history  before commenting here. Haiti belongs to France that's why they speak french and they were slaves. They are good people but Haiti is ran by a  very corrupt government since the French left. Remember papa Doc?
"Even if you did say what they claim you said, who can really argue that those countries aren't in terrible shape? It's also funny to me that the same people who are acting so outraged over your alleged comments regularly refer to 'flyover America' as a shithole, say things like 'America was never great', etc. If it's as awful here as they regularly claim and Haiti is in fact not a shithole, why would they want those Haitians to leave their beautiful nation to come here? _Ÿ˜è"
"Mr. President, I voted for you and respect you BUT  apply what you said about â€œnot saying anything derogatoryâ€ù about Haiti to other countries. They arenâ€™t â€œSh..holes.â€ù  You are in the highest position in the USA to â€œserve and supportâ€ù the people not to condescend. All people matter.   Thank you."
Probably one of the more rational statements made by a Trump supporter...
"The Democrats have a different phrase. They like ""Banana Republic"". Like when Trump told Hillary she would be in jail. Democrats all came out and said ""we are not some Banana Republic"", which means the same thing. ...an underdeveloped poor nation with little education and technology, capable only of picking and exporting bananas. Yes, usually ran by some backward despot. Democrats also shined over the old Coffee Boy from Kenya comment. They also didn't cate when the Clinton Foundation fleeced Haiti out of millions it collected in donations. Trump's description, although not PC is pretty much spot on."
No one is immigrating to Haiti for a reason. It is not a pleasant place to live.
"Because it is a s***hole, as many other countries are, that is why they all want to come here.  Let's be honest."
"very true, i come from one of those countries, Trump is telling the truth"
Haiti was raped by the Clintons
Nav Charmaine  Yes. It was. But it was a shithole long before that.
Living in Florida ft lauderdale Miami area knew a lot of Haitians . They immigrate here fir a reason !!
Can you please fix this Healthcare?- my cousin is undergoing chemo & turned away last visit because of his insurance! Iâ€™m livid & probably will bring this all to Washington- you can make things happen & I appreciate you Mr. President. God Bless you & God Bless USA _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
Just for the record... he said â€œ why we would want people â€œ he was talking about people from there no the country... but of course all his followers have a excuse for his behavior...
Haiti is a sh..t hole thanks to the Clinton Foundation.  They collected a lot of money for Haiti and kept it in their foundation. Haiti didn't receive any of it to help rebuild. No one had the guts to go after the Clinton's.
"Sorry, too late! We ALL heard You! You're a liar and the truth is not in You! You and your bloodthirsty Trumpanzees don't get it...but you soon will!"
You didn't hear anything
Go ahead and defend that lying lunatic if you want; he's still the pits!
Bloodthirsty Trumpanzees?  You may want to study more scripture to learn you're not a nice person.
Mark Carter-Pierce you still didn't hear anything just making it up
Im NOT afraid to speak the truth! Please do not try to bring that self righteous evangelical crap to me! Youre a Pharisee; you bring scripture into it to defend a man who is atypical to the ways of Christ!
"Rev. Mark Carter-Pierce...You are sharing, judging & crucifying our President for something he DID NOT state.  Anonymous biased political rhetrioic/attacks are unfounded.  Be better than that...Calling someone a ""lunatic"" is slander, in case you were unaware.  Isn't that HATE speech...May God soften your heart & raise your standards..."
"David Davis...Exactly...  It's sad misinformation is being shared from a liberal biased democratic political party whose candidate LOST.  They would rather see our beloved Country fail than support a duly elected President. The fix was in for Hillary Clinton & she still didn't win...  They cannot seem to move forward...  Pathetic..."
"You parrots don't get it...Hillary is OLD news; the only ones still talking about her is Trump and you minions. Admit it, you're not smart enough to see what's going on, you're incapable of independent thought, and frankly I believe that he speaks for what you really feel. You claim to be ""Patriots""? Real ""Americans""? Yet you go against the ideals of the Founding Fathers and the Constitution! What the hell is wrong with You?They have books on audio now...study what this country is about under the Founding Fathers vision!"
"Liberal, socialist democrats are attempting to destroy the very basis of our Founding Fathers...Our Constitution....You seem to be ""atypical""...  You are NOT speaking the truth...  Your attack is based on a lie & yet, you call our PRESIDENT a liar...  Slander...  Wise up...Mark Carter-Pierce..."
"Give me a break JanLea...I may be atypical to your evangelical values, but I do speak the truth which you are unable to accept. AND, the CONSTITUTION has something called the FIRST AMENDMENT, which guarantees me the right to free speech, which your dictator would like to silence. I'm entitled to my opinion, and I will continue to speak It!"
"Mark Carter-PierceCarter-Pierce...Sorry, Mark, no break...  Post a lie & you will receive responses...  Just an opinion in response to yours...The First Amendment does not ""guarantee"" you the right to slander/lie.  You opinion should NOT be based on a lie...""Atypical"" is a quote of what you said, not me...Your ""Bloodthirsty"" namecalling comment is over the top, rude, unkind & ridiculous...  What problem do you have with an duly elected President who is bringing jobs back to our Country & giving Americans a well deserved tax break...  You DO realize you have another three years & then, you can VOTE, again for the candidate of your choice...I truly pray that God will soften your heart & raise your standards...  Please STOP the HATE MONGERING...In the future, stick to facts & truth while sharing your opinions...Please note, I did not respond to you with unkind namecalling or ""assuming"" & attacking your religious affiliations...  Make it a good day, sir."
To call someone a Trumpanzee is wrong. Nothing wrong with differing opinions and views but no need for silly names.
"They gave it to me, I gave it back to them. I let them know that I am willing to go toe to toe, and when they bring the Sesame Street garbage I can roll with them. This is where Obama and I differ: I will play them hard. If he had done that with Congress we would have gotten more positive things accomplished."
Sorry on this thread I do not see anyone calling you names.
It's a long story. The people who started it got my message.
But 2 wrongs never add up to a right.
"Speaking about Haiti, did you ever ask G W BUSH or BILL CLINTON what happened to all the money that we, USA citizens, donated FOR THEM after the earthquake?    The Haitians are still waiting for it!"
Oh No! is telling the truth in a behind closed door meeting. The truth couldn't possibly help in make the right decision could it?  Notice didn't say anything about people but the actual country itself. Should have been left behind closed doors.
"Unfortunately, in today's political atmosphere and the fake news, recording is almost a must.  You are correct, there is no trust.  However, I and your other supporters trust in you to make America Great Again.  Kudos to you President Trump, kudos to you."
"I am just so ashamed, again, yet again, of you, of you representing the people of the United States, of you opening your mouth to speak on behalf of the people of the United States, and of you being so ignorant, of you not understanding, and not willing to learn about, how diversity strengthens this country."
"You, are a lying shithole. Hoping you flunk your physical with a disease that would preclude you from further ruining our, what was, beautiful country. You are an embarrassment world wide."
"Here is what I have to say on the issue.Multiplied billions of dollars were poured into the country to help them.Between the Clintons and the Govet of Haiti, the people have received nothing but what individual churches and a few well known people have helped.I think we should drain the Clinton's accounts, and get these people back on their feet."
"I would not trust ANYONE, other than myself, to discern what you (Trump) actually say. I would want a complete tape of the entire conversation, so nothing would be taken out of context, and I would want to hear and see those ACTUAL words coming out of your mouth before I would even believe that is what you said. Journalism today is nothing more than gossip from tabloids and our media is lying to us every day!"
"President Donald J. Trump, you actually love Haiti and Africa more that anyone else this include Haitians and Africans themselves. There is a lot of hypocrisy of love that has been going on for decades and centuries concerning these continents. As a matter of facts, your stance will make these continents start to work hard. We love you, Donald J. Trump..!"
"Why has Haiti still not recovered from the earthquake? More than 500 million was raised for a population of less than 11 million. Where is the world class wireless/wifi access promised by Bill Clinton? Was that money diverted to pay for Chelsea's wedding?  Why aren't the citizens profiting from the gold mining operation or are all the profits being sucked up by Hillary's brother? Was there ever an accounting of where the $500 million was spent? That is what is important. And to all the pearl clutchers out there, were you just as outraged when Bubba defiled interns on top of the oval office desk?"
There is the very serious issue of Senators refusing to recognize the privacy of closed door meetings. Diane Feinstein and other Senators who do not recognize that privacy should not be invited to participate  in those meetings. I would suggest the President select a completely new group of bipartisan Senators. The issue of the fake news constant reporting gossip as fact is a serious but lesser problem.
White people created these poor countries. You and your ancestors love creating a problem then walking away like nothing ever happened.
"The progressive liberal, socialist media SHOULD be asking where all the millions raised to help Haiti went?? It DID NOT go to help it's people...Anyone who has been there knows this...  Love you Mr. President...."
The people that don't agree with what was said about those countries should go live their lives there too see for themselves what great countries they are!
"You said that Haiti is fine again, and then withdrew their immigration status, sending them back into a ""shithole"".  You make about as much sense as Jalepeno flavored condoms."
"To gillhooligan:If Haiti is fine.....Why immigrate then ?????"
"I never said that Haiti is fine, Trump did, a year ago when he stripped them of their protected status.  You can't have it both ways.  You snowflakes need to learn how to take a criticism without getting your panties in a knot.  If you think that Haiti is a ""shithole"", then why are you ok with the President sending Haitians back?  Is it that you just don't care about them?"
"I voted for you because I was hoping you would unite the people of this country. Comments like that are making things worse. Please, please, Mr. President, think before you send out something like that for the whole world to see. It creates more hate and the world does not need that. _Ÿ˜¢"
"One day I woke up, and found myself in a world where the moral arbiters of society were the ones who routinely churn out garbage on TV, use profanity and vulgar language and behavior on the regular, celebrate their murder of babies, promote drugs and pornography, and promote criminality."
Record all conversations when liberals are in the room. We all know their only objective is to destroy you and this country.
"Itâ€™s the corrupt leadership and governments that keep their people in poverty, for the most part.  Not the peopleâ€™s faults. In this country we are trying to throw off the corrupted establishment leadership stranglehold. That is why we elected Trump."
"Very aggravating that leftist politicians, ceo's, actors, etc. Are only concerned with the welfare of illegals, Haiti, etc. People like Jeff Bezos who is giving millions to illegals, but not to struggling Americans like seniors, vets, soldiers, firemen, disabled, etc should be ashamed. Do they think there are no legal, genuine citizens who must make do with very little?!_Ÿ˜¡"
"I posted images of Haiti and El Salvador in one post.  One guy went into denial and challenged the veracity of those pictures, because he wanted to attack the president's word choice.  It's called Cognitive Dissonance.  He then posted wide shots of big cities to try to compensate.  I am proud of my president for being completely accurate in his description of these places and wanting a strong immigration policy.  We usually call these places hell holes."
"What I find interesting in this post is that you purposefully choose to defend yourself regarding Haiti. What about the other â€œshitholeâ€ù places you mentioned such as El Salvador and parts of Africa? Perhaps, since your usual routine is to grasp at the very thin ribbon of truth that you rarely tell, you are defending your reference to Haiti because you cannot honestly defend yourself regarding the other â€œshitholeâ€ù places you referred to."
"I think D Trump meant to say uncivilized countries.   Some Rich and spoiled people tend to not have as much control over their tongues.   Doesnâ€™t mean they are bad people.  They have big hearts too.  They just need to work on having better manors in the office.   I feel like the USA has turned into Epcot theme park.  No one speaks English anymore. There are large pockets of neighborhoods that feel like a foreign country and they donâ€™t like outsiders.  Immigrants need to melt into the American culture appreciate our laws and values.   Not turn state countyâ€™s into the countries they left."
The Clintons stole Millions from what was supposed to go towards some of the rebuilding of Haiti.. How did CNN will not do stories on this shows their dishonor.. I cant believe that there are so many journalists there that are ok with that.
The liberals are so fast to blame Trump on the condition of the Haiti...when they should be blaming the Clinton's for pocketing all the money into the Clinton Foundation that was suppose to help the Haitians out...the guilty are always the first to yell and scream and the liberals have been doing a lot of that for the last year!!!
Have spoken with a few immigrants and they are very upset by Trumps comments. A few told me they would leave our country and go back home if their countries weren't such shitholes.  ;)
Had a daughter of a older nephew go too Haiti with a church group to work a little. She told about the armed escort they had to have an how they were told not to go off alone or without a armed escort to look around. They were told not to wear any type of jewelry and she told me how happy she was to get back home. Maybe the news media can look into what the Hillary foundation did in Haiti. ( laughing at the last part )
"If the American politicians did pocketed the reconstruction Money, Haitians wouldnt want to stay in the US. We need an investigation on that earthquake fund."
"AMERICANS didn't ""pocketed the reconstruction Money"". The CLINTONS and their fat cat FRIENDS pocketed the reconstruction money.  :-("
"They represented the US government in Haiti, another form of colonisation of my country.why do you think Haiti is so poor? Why we never have political and economic stability on the Island? Please miss Ludy Gibson don't defend them, you know the truth."
"POTUS45 media and democrats are serial liars.....better than half America is not drinking the kool-aid. The media that does not out and out lie tell half-truths to generate mouth running time. The clintons saved haiti so they should all be where they come from anyway.....BUT, why not leave when you are paid to be useless. Please send them all home so they can rebuild what the clintons missed"
"Why wasn't that meeting recorded? Why are not all meetings recorded, if not for your own protection? Instead your argument isAmerica: Did you a bad word? Donny: Nuh-uh. Haiti is my friend. Mary is always on me!America: So what did you really say? Donny: I never said anything!"
"maybe if you stayed off social media and let your actions represent you, and when you have something to say stand up and say it with clearity and authority,when i was young if the president broke into primetime tv,our parents made us shut up and listen the president has something to say and we owe it to our country to listen,so please quit hiding behind press secrataries and twitter and show your face when you speak,"
"One way to prove one way or the other is make public the audio recording. Now that is transparency. Everyone will be accountable for their language. As a citizen I hold all political gov't officials to a high standard. You all represent each individual in the country. Everyone one of you need to clean up you mouths, actions and representation. Now let's hear audio and get to work."
"Let's hear the audio from the previous president too, then.  Good for the goose, good for the gander.  I'll bet he had plenty of ""choice"" words that he wouldn't want repeated in public."
"I agree but you have to start somewhere. With recent controversies bad language was not made public. Now it is, like the child hands in cookie jar. We assume other political persons got away with it. Please mind you I am holding ALL accountable. Our counties reputation is at stake. We have a chance here to have our country lived and respected or brushed off and ignored."
"Janet Jones And if the reporters are proven to lie what do we do with them.  Remember when what GMA edited the travon martin police dispatcher records to ruin a mans life.  Remember the media perpetuating the hands up lie.  Even after it has come to light that the dems funded the fake dossiers  the media  continues to tell the lies.   Yes, I agree we have no room for lies and deceit today just as we should have had no room for clinton and obamas lies yet the media seems to favor some.  Remember when they said a youtube move caused the attack?"
Melvin Boyce the white house could make it part of the briefings. This hold media avenues accountable. Caught in twisting truth means lower ratings not good for revenue. Can't manipulate transparency. It is what it is. Will cause people to think what they want to say before engaging their mouths.
"Everyone gets huffy over calling a sh*thole country, a sh*thole country. Why? Would you rather turn a blind eye to the plight of these countriesâ€™ citizens and act like itâ€™s all sunshine and rainbows?!"
Yes. He would rather turn a blind eye twoards them. He'd much rather have white immigrants from a country whose name he can't spell
"Because expecting those protected by TPS to make moves to gain citizenship in the years theyâ€™ve been in the country already is too much to ask? They are permitted to apply for citizenship and once they do apply, they receive continued protection while going through the process. When they received the temporary protected status, they were likely informed it wasnâ€™t a long-term solution and it would have been wise to make efforts to gain citizenship before time ran out. As for cutting the amount of immigrants we take in a year by half, itâ€™s a logical step. Considering that we already have a staggering amount of people in this country (many impoverished), it would be insane to keep bleeding more and more people in at our current rate."
"You said the right thing, don't take a word back. I support you, let the media spead lies we know they are lies. And yes those countries are not good places, they are run down and the people live in squalor, violence and perpetual destruction. We do not want those type of people in our country, and we certainly have never been welcome in theirs."
"Haiti has been handed billions of US aid, the missions run by churches have done many things to help them. The government in Haiti has reaped the profit while the people starve. Haiti has an upper class that rapes the poor. Trump is speaking truth if he did say the statements."
Whatever happened to all the money that Bush and Clinton raised for Haiti. Think about it. The Dominican Replubic and Haiti share the same island. One side is a shithole and the other prospers.
"I for one would never believe the lying Democratic Party who have lied for the last 8 years.  They sold our Uranium, conducted pay for play schemes, missing money from Haiti contributions and more.   I think I will believe the President of the United States -He is a straight shooter.  He has accomplished so much and is fighting hard to save our country.  God Bless President Trump and family!"
"Stop bringing the Clintons to Haitiâ€™s problem. The problem is withing ourselves, as Haitian, if we do work together and also work for the country we wouldnt need no international mofos tryna help us but in reality they are stealing more. The Clintons did it _Ÿ_·_Ÿè_â€çâ™‚ï¸è thatâ€™s pretty much the mentality of most High power in the US. Go in for help but dismantle the country instead."
"Even if you did say that... It's the truth.Doesn't mean anything about its people. The country truly is a mess.Nothing wrong with being honest. That's why I like you.Unfortunately the democratic party still searches for a message and an agenda, and for the lack of anything better the only thing they can do in the meantime is cry and become offended by everything you do... Even when it's positive"
"USA is the most corrupt country in the world yes Haiti is a poor country but we are honest poor countries, there are countries that only prevent poor countries from developing, countries like USA are only profiting from poor countries in order to keep their place of great power"
"It would be very easy to prove. Six senators were in that meeting. Graham, Durbin, Flake, Bennett, Gardner and Menendez.  Ask them."
No one has denied it except trump
No one has confirmed that those were the words he used either
"It was a private conversation, was it not?  Anyone who has ever been to Haiti knows what it is.  Clintons treated the place like it was their private country....even juimped into the presiential elections when they wanted a certain president (wow...some things never change do they?).  Her brother 'runs' the goldmine.  There has been human trafficking and organ harvesting drug smuggling and killing is on everyday.  They took all that disaster money(for their 'foundation') and almost a decade later the poor people of Haiti STILL dont have electric power, clean water (they use the used water from the 5 star hotel the clintons built for their elite pals, no doubt) and they dont have proper shelter.  I believe they  built a couple of token houses, maybe a school (not sure) and a 5 star hotel and a new road that runs directly from the airport to the hotel.....Shut up Liberals because I think this is fine time for POTUS to rehash and focus on yet another Clinton sin."
"Jeff Flake came forward and stated Trump's words were ""abhorrent and repulsive, not tough""."
These are sh** hole countries...doesn't mean you are calling residents sh** holes.    So please find something more substantial to discuss.   OUR President needs to find out who leaked that private discussion and boot him /her to the streets.  Our America is becoming GREAT AGAIN due to President Trump....i love that he calls it like it is...no filter...all transparency!!!!
"We believe you President Trump however, it's an excellent idea to record  everything.  Their only  giving you a hard time about Haiti in order to cover up Killary's crimes against Haiti.  Fortunately, we the people are much smarter than the Donkey Media."
"The democrats want a socialist country,proven with Saul Alinsky agenda,anObama/Hillary teacher. They don't care who lives in poverty,even blacks. Like crazy millionaire Pelosi said,Americans only make crumbs. Where's Hillarys millions she never gave to Haiti? Trump is trying to save our country from becoming another socialist country,only poor & themselves,rich. Trump is not the corrupt politically correct politician like democrats. That's why true patriotic Americans love him!"
"Yes, record the meetings and usher out anyone who shows disrespect to you. Some people think they are in charge and a bossy woman is just about the worst thing ever."
"Hello Shirley Good Morning, Iâ€™d like to be friends with you. Clarence"
You are so stupid and have lack of education. If you are a woman like this you are so low and never succeeded in your life. Plus we don't live in Russia to be punished by voicing ourselves out. Smart women are not about what you are. Oprah president 2020 is predicted in 2002 by cartoonists. How you feel about this crapy devote. _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸. Go to school.
Great post Shirley Jacobsen! I totally agree.
Yes thatâ€™s exactly how I took what he said. He did not say anything about the people. Haiti is a mess and I feel bad for the people there. That is why I try to do something about it. I sponsor a little boy there.  If everyone did that it would be a better place. Isnâ€™t that a better idea than wasting time bashing our President because he said a swear word?
Another Russian like story where Dems redirected the blame to you. Remember what Hillary did to Haiti and their children. Another witch hunt.
"It must be remembered that the destinies of Haiti and the United States of America have crossed since 1779 when 500 Haitian soldiers headed by General Lafayette fought against the troops of American troops in the war of independence. Similarly in 1814 several hundred Haitians led by part of the Battle of New Orleans to protect the independence of the United States of America when the British want to reclaim their former colony.The relationship between the two countries is strengthened by the fact that millions of Haitian sons and daughters have contributed, continue and continue to contribute to the prosperity and greatness of America. In the same way, the spontaneous solidarity of the American people towards the Haitian people in their difficult moments consolidates, for a long time, the base of their unfailing friendship.The Haitian government calls for respect for the dignity of peoples, the preservation of the humanist tradition that does not honor the United States of America, as well as the values â€‹â€‹of solidarity, altruism and respect for human rights. the differences that have made this country, over its history, a haven of freedom and a land of welcome for millions of immigrants from all over the world and from all over the world."
"Yes Mr President record all those meetings I believe you din't talk about Haiti people, is true the is a very poor country the if the Clinton's wouldn't robbed so much money after the earthquake with her fake foundation they would be a little better today."
"I know, I get it... but you've had a year now to learn and grow as a world leader, surly to God you comprehend how ""you"" keep shooting ""yourself"" in the foot. Can you please give ""me"" a inkling, a glimmer of hope this year two. In the future before you tweet, just show the content to anyone else and get their feedback. All the good you are doing is constantly being shadowed by your blundering bravado. You have a whole team of professionals surrounding you, there is no shame in using them... It's called a team effort.     I'm a Trump fan and applaud your business sense and patriotism, but in need of seeing professional growth with your public relations... soon, very soon. #ImGrowingWearyFromDefendingYou"
There is a lot of demon controlled people in this world so yes Trump you will be tested keep up the good work I have no complaints God has this and so He wins in the end . Thank you Trump and record everything so we can laugh at them we are tired of fake news _Ÿ˜_
"YOU ARE so right! The devil has gotten into the hearts of many people.  I pray for our president and his family. Also, I don't understand why people want him to fail because then we as a country fail. Who in their right mind would want that?!"
"The race bating destructionists would rather see the country fold and the world topple , than see the president carry this country above the hell Obama and Hilary had planned. Theyâ€™re so busy talking about insignificant, they donâ€™t know what China, Korea or Russia is doing. So short sided. So dangerous."
"Peter Heck we can take criticism, just funny when you liberals have your panties in a tight bunch. We don't care for your opinion as much as you don't care for ours. It is a shithole country. Doesn't say anything about the people just who is running it.  Lol"
We love you trump. Democrats will make everything you say and twist it. The trust with Democrats has been destroyed they will never hold the presidency again. Keep doing what your doing about time we have a leader who cares for his country and isnâ€™t worried about the world and votes. America is greater since you became our leader and thanks for giving the American working class a voice again.
"It doesn't matter what Trump says the left are a bunch of brain dead people that have no clue of what we the people want in this country, as do most of the right in office. Keep up what you are doing if it pisses them off it means that you are doing your job."
"Mr Trump. Ignore the press and continue to work for us the voters. Youâ€™re bringing more jobs and letting us hold more of our hard earned paychecks. Continue these things and youâ€™ll have my vote again. Do not waste your energy fighting obstructive and divisive democrats.

"I have a great idea T...carry a tape recorder with you everywhere so that we can all hear everything you say. This way when your despicable words are heard, right out of the horses mouth, we all know which stable you should live in."
I don't care if he said this. I've said much worse. We need only loyal reliable hard working people in this country. They must love our flag anthem and country. They must assimilate. I believe new immigrants should not receive welfare for at least ten years.
"Mr. Trump, I whole-heartedly disagree with your comments about immigrants from Africa and Haiti. Some of them are my friends, and Iâ€™m grateful they are here in my community. I pray for a day when honor, grace, decorum, compassion, and kindness can return to the White House."
"You know who doesn't have a good relationship with the Haitians? The Clinton Foundation, which held out promised hurricane relief funds until the Haitian government gave a nephew of theirs the county's mineral rights, furthering that country into poverty. And people actually voted for her."
"Haiti was one of the countries being discussed when you stated Sh??hole countries.  What made you fly off was when bringing more Haitians in was brought up.  EVERYONE in that meeting (except YOU) verified the same words.  So, recording your meetings won't help."
Start taping everything. Also perhaps the double-standard of profanity allowed on cable news and no one else is allowed might need to be reviewed because they have poisoned the airwaves with fake news inflammatory profanity to instigate emotional reaction of anger towards our POTUS deliberately!
WH didnt deny the words
Ernest Muraoka Who cares they are words and they are true...its not the people its the place.
"Where did the $13 billion go that the Trumps put themselves in charge of .  The annual GDP of Haiti is 8.06 billion.  So every person, and business didn't have to work for an entire 1.75 years, and it still looks the same as when the earthquake happened"
The USA gives Haiti 300 million dollars every year and itâ€™s still in terrible condition. Perhaps we should really consider investing in legal Americans instead.
I would take Trumpâ€™s word over any Democratic politician.  They have proven over and over that they are willing to lie and cover up any scandal/corruption by their party leaders and that goes for Republicans too.  You may not like how Trump presents issues but he speaks plainly and Iâ€™m not offended_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
"The liberals are desperate..grasping at straws!Thanks for keeping it real!No bargining with Congress! Keep your word to the American people!!Make Congress vote and we will be watching!Then we will know who to vote out of office!God bless our President who loves our Country and truly cares for the American people!!!!"
"To all you high And mighty libs?Tell me would you live in Haiti?And if not Why?The Government there i's evil,Plus many over there are crimmals.,Not all Many are struggling.But why wasn't anything said when The Clinton's Robbed them?"
You really don't understand the problem with what he said? Americans are a special kind of stupid.
"Carl hush!I I really do understand what he Said I herd it.American's are special kind of Stupid?So your not American?Well there you go.If the government over their would take care of its people,That country wouldn't be the way it is.And What The president said Is the Truth. Period!I don't think you know the problem Carl, Or understand? They're hurting people over there.And in America we Have hurting people that live in slums,Those are the ones who need taking care of.President Trump is,Raw in his delivery,But He is right.America must come First,We need productive people Who will help the problem.We have taken care of Countries who can careless, About us.I'm sadden with what they go through in Haiti,But they need Help each other.By The,way we are sending aid there.This country because of Obama is in A mess.We Have A president who cares About America,And it will be fixed!"

"Ask Hillary since she likes to accuse you, about Tony Rodham mining gold from Haiti's gold mines. The corrupt government and the Clinton Foundation probably laundered all of it spending the help for the people. How dare her open her mouth. She's used up and done."
"If Haiti is a mess, apparently much of the fault lies on the Clintons from what we have heard. Besides, listening to democrats feign outrage over a crude word or comment is hilarious. They should listen to themselves and their own leaders."
"Dick Durbin, how many times have YOU vacationed in Haiti, you didnt bc it is in squalor another word for shithole"
"What the President was saying is, that countries like Haiti are S holes due to people like the Clintons that have raised millions through the Clinton foundation to rebuild Haiti and it never got done and the Clintons kept the money. Also organizations like the UN and UNICEF that have done virtually nothing considering the amounts of money they were given to do so."
This is really sad that President Trump has to go through crap like this... what he said is in this article and no more and no less he was just stating that they are for country and they are... What's the big deal that's a fact
"Anybody else notice he didnâ€™t actually deny the main thing that he is accused of saying? He said he never said â€œtake them outâ€ù, which I honestly hadnâ€™t even heard anyone claim he said. He is accused of saying Haiti is a â€œsh**holeâ€ù. Whether that is a true statement or not - the man still did not deny saying it."
"those countries are what he said and worse, we feel sorry for the innocent people are stuck there, but we can't take all of the world in, we would go broke and most of the time, many bring that kind of world into another, this country is already in bad shape because of the democrats and obama,  Trump is trying to fix it, but the mess Bush and Obama left will take a long time, to fix"
"You know.. I would understand completely President Trump.. A billionaire who could be playing golf and enjoying his older years, yet he has chosen â€˜thisâ€™ all this visceral because he loves this country. I donâ€™t want you to walk away but would understand!!Ps No one migrated from a great country but most commonly from a s**thole country. Yep I said it and itâ€™s true.

"So, Hillary can pocket the money Clinton Foundation promised, and decide the Haitians weren't important enough to her goal, so she pocketed the money, while the man who came up here to testify as to the Clinton corruption to Haiti, and is found dead before arriving. Hmmmmm?"
"Ok, lets be clear. You said why do we have to take those people from Haiti, send them back. Then you said, you want people from Norway. so the place isnt the shithole, its the people."
"Hahaha Liberals and Democrats go crazy over everything he says. News Flash, weather you choose to live in reality or not, Haiti is not a nice place to live. All you bleeding heart libs should pack up and move there. Mabe you can make it a better place, if you can keep the clintons out of your wallets."
"A very poor and troubled country that we have aided for years, despite the financial rape of the clinton administration. At this point, we may as well make them a territory like Puerto Rico and tax them."
"Ronald Reagan was known as the Great Communicator and Leader of the Free World because he spoke the truth in a way that inspired his constituents, opposing parties, allies and enemies. He acted serisouly and was taken seriously. I'm optimistic about a lot of the positive things happening in our country right now; however, Donald Trump needs to tone down the delivery of his messages a bit. I understand America is pissed off (and rightfully so if you ask me) due to 8 years of ""pen and phone"" Executive Orders that ignored the will of the people while bowing and appeasing to our enemies but if we contninue down the path of separating opposing viewponts and beliefes then we will truly be a nation divided that subsequently will fall."
"Instead of sending money to countries who need help, why not, in the future - see what help they need and provide only those things instead. Such as Haiti.... we have sent millions and millions... it's obvious whom ever is receiving the money is corrupt. How about we send lumber and materials to build homes... and some contractors over to build them with the help of their people - like the people who need a home, help with their home etc.??"
"Thank you Trump for the treatment you've gave HaitiansOne Day,  one day I say one day Haiti will be raise up in Jesus' name"
"They have NO, ZERO, NADA, integrity. Their Legacy is steeped in deception, perversion of truth and power at ANY cost. They will continue to FALL, and you to RISE. PSALMS 2, give honor to whom honor is due, and you will stand as a shining light in the History of your country for generations to come.God Bless you, Sir."
The Clinton's have taken Haiti gold and money that should have gone to the cause during the hurricanes. Instead they stole from this poor and troubled country to increase their foundation! Nothing was done! It seems like the Crooked Clintons get away with everything.
"It is the truth. The president is right. The  sooner ""the unformed,"" including ridiculous democrats and do-gooders,  wake up to the reality that our country can only sustain so many influxes of third world hoards, the problem will continue to be politicized."
"Leftists, theyâ€™re more offended by this than the immigrants leaving countries that they know are _Ÿ’© holes to come to out country! What a joke"
A President who speaks the truth and the snowflakes can't stand it. Look at these countries they are s---holes. Terrible living conditions. But don't forget the Clinton's robbed Haiti of millions of dollars in donations to help the people. President Trump is the best President ever. He loves this country unlike our last President.
"When I read how the dem's and some rep's treat our president, like the left not finding any concrete things against the president and then hit him for things they are most likely guilty of themselves. It is quite hypocritical to say the least. I am not justifying idle words. I'm just saying. Makes me think of the Bible verse: Matthew 23:23-24King James Version (KJV)23 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.24 Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel."
CNN likes to twist words to mean other things... they should be fined for reporting news incorrectly. They are a news agency not a news making one. False stories should be Don Lemon's trademark. FAKE NEWS.
"If liberals cared about Haiti so much, maybe they should go live there and give them their own money.  But they won't because it sucks there.."
Personally I was hurt that they said you said this. I'm glad you clarified. One of the smartest scientist I worked with was born in Haiti. She told me she often cried for the lack of infrastructure her motherland had and wished all had the advantages the USA had.
"What a shithaole Haiti is ! Not the country , the country is beautiful , not the people all though all countrys have a portion of their populous  that is of questionable integrity.But what promotes my opinion is the last Haitian disaster when we send millions of dollars in water. Food and med supply's and their government would not let it through unless USA paid tariffs  .What a shithaole country"
"I listened to Glen Beck carryon this morning about how the Irish cAme here in the early 1900â€™s from a country that was considered a â€˜sh**holeâ€™ at that time. How a lot were indentured servants (not much above slavery) and how they became people who did wonderful things for this country. I have no problem with what I wrote in the previous paragraph. What I have an issue with is we did not provide those people with foot stamps, free insurance, etc. for life. Those people cAme in worked their butts off repaid their indenture and became producing members of society. Not so now a days they come in stay on the public dole forever."
"""In addition, the president singled out Haiti, telling lawmakers that immigrants from that country must be left out of any deal, these people said.'Why do we need more Haitians?' Trump said, according to people familiar with the meeting. â€œTake them out.â€ù"
"This is all over the news. Nothing about the growing economy, jobs, nothing! I for one could care less about what Oprah, Obama, or eve what Stephen Colbert's ""opinions"" are. Turn the channel!!!! That's why we have remotes. LOL!"
"Good Morning Carol, Iâ€™d like for us to be friends & get to know more about each other. Clarence"
NEVER EVER trust a democrat!  Especially when it comes to the matter of immigration or trade.  They would sell us off piece by piece if they had their way so long as they could pad their own off shore bank accounts.
Yep.....
They just keep digging. We are used to it so very seldom believe anything written or said. Just look at your progress and what steps our country takes to go forward. Gossip stays with them.
"The Clinton Foundation had other countries donate food to Haiti and, of course, the Clintons took the credit. Ignorant of the inner workings of Haiti, the Clintons were actually responsible for putting the Haiti farmers out of businesss. Isnâ€™t that just like a democrat.  Wherever they go unemployment follows and poverty spreads"
"The truth hurts the whiny sensitive people living in a bubble! Go find your corner and scream, cry, grasp your pink hat, call your mommy, do what you need to do. Today is another day!"
If he called some of those places Shitholes than he was only saying what everyone is thinking. I have been a democrat all my life but I call them Shitholes. And I voted for Trump.. So guess we think alike..
Fine thank you ..
"Millions of immigrates are fleeing America because it is a $hithole country. No wait they are fleeing $hithole countries to places like America. Because of $hithole socialist and Dictatorial leadership. President sez those weren't his words, I believe him. Nothing plastic about him"
"These are the same people, (making up lies), that are still angry Hillary didn't win?  She destroyed any chance of Haiti healing and rebuilding when SHE stole all their $$$$ leaving it a very troubled poor country."
"I do not know why people are speaking badly about Trump, I like him because he says what come from his heart,  he is sincere,  not false. He does not hide his word,  or pretend, which country would like to receive people coming from poor countries, such as Africa? Why do people have to hide in the US instead of solving problems in their countries? Let's be honest TRUMP is not false. Stop taking care of my house to refuge in the neighbor's house? That does not make sense. I support Trump, do not let any African people enter the US, I repeat, do not let any, because maybe this decision is going to be the solution of our misery. THANK YOU TRUMP."
"Mr. President: Even if you said it, it is - sadly - all too true.  Corruptocracies whose leaders pocket whatever wealth is produced - and a lot of the foreign aid, as well - and leave their people living in squalor, starving to death.   And so their populations want to flee to a land of opportunity.  Unfortunately, we can't take them all.  Speaking of corruptocrats: what a shame all that aid to Haiti disappeared into the Clinton coffers."
The earthquake happened 8 years ago. It happened on 12 January 2010. I remember people saving people and using their hands to dig people out of the ruble. They had no machines. This says enough about what kind of country Haiti is.
I knew you didn't say that Mr President. People are so gullable to believe anything. I'm sorry you have to deal with such rudeness. Thanks for all you are doing. You are a hard working and very kind man. Don't quit!!!
"Yep, they sure are gullible..."
"Explain to me how their countries are not shitholes? Haiti is a terrible place and was dedicated to Satan by the leader, Somalia is a very terrible place, I guarantee if you tried to visit, you would die there."
"i for one am thrilled that the left is finally revealing there true feelings about this country . you have exposed your contempt for american society and a majority of the people who made this country great...get ready for the mid terms, another rebuke of your insanity is at hand. MAGA."
"I am wondering how we are so oppressed in this country? The shithole countries are the countries where their leaders oppress their people.  I have a friend who is a pilot, and when he goes over North Korea he is heartbroken.  The little mans castle is the only thing that has electricity, they are the only ones with food. There are regimes trying with their lives to overturn their leaders in Iran.  Can we start sharing what has made our country great?  I eat, i have fuel for the fire, so we are warm, we are cool in the summer.  I take extra cash to give away.  My dad had a 3rd grade education and yet supported his family  and then ours.Where are you hurting?  Tell us about that.We live in a country where we have a voice, but in reality the voices are starting to sound like people who carry false burdens. Burdens that are not ours to carry."

"He is supposed to be the president of the United States.  Not just some ignorant loud mouthed republican con.Someone needs to put a cork in it.He is destroying the United States on purpose."
"No the country was destroyed on purpose by Obama, who was nothing more than a smooth talker, with well written speeches. He flooded our country with these so-called immigrants looking for handouts, now we have this to deal with. For the past 8 years, we have listened to cop killings, racial hatred, and division, daily reports of so-called innocent black men killed unjustly by cops, who later turned out to be guilty as sin, then statues and memorials made to honor them. Sanctuary cities have sprung up everywhere, which we have to house and feed, and the budget was a disaster. We would rather have a man who speaks the honest truth than someone who is a snake oil salesman. Haven't you noticed how all the unjustified killings by cops have stopped since he left office, because he and the media perpetuated it all, causing daily violence, looting, burning, looting, and cop killings. He was pure evil. It is so nice not to have to wake up with this every day of our lives."
Shithole America
Really? Greatest country in the History of the world. There is no wall keeping you in.
Have any of  you ever been there????? I have and it is a shithole..when our cruise ship stopped there and I was shopping the owner of shop told me to be very careful and not to go any further because it was very dangerous and I'd most likely get shot...I went straight back to the ship. When we stopped in Jamaica the cruise ship had it's own personal beach and the vendors were set up to sell their goods...over the hill where armed guards and a fence...In Cozumel we were warned that it may not be safe to travel without a guide...scary stuff...so I do NOT care that he called what it is...and I sure don't want this country turning into the same and you democrats are hell bent on turning it into one..

"The President lives in reality. The main street media does NOT.  The media lives in ""breaking news alerts,""  whether true or false,  accurate or not accurate.  This country really needs to grow up, and face reality, and stop living in the Obama negative bubble."
We should take some immigrants from all classes. The poor wretches from the shitholes as well as educated from Norway or wherever. It should be balanced . Now it's not. Bottom heavy.  Should be top heavy if anything. Can't h. That's what he is saying.  Future refugees want to come to a rich successful country too. Can't bring it down too much and turn it into the places they are fleeing from.
AMEN!!!  Words of wisdom!!
Those countries have serious problems.  Their people need to fix those problems.  Our country cant afford to fix all these other countries problems.  America First !!!
We heard from Tom Cotton that what is being reported was wrong. We will certainly believe Tom Cotton over Dick Durbin. Haiti might be better off if the Clinton's  hadn't done this.  https://geopolitics.co/2016/10/11/haiti-needs-2-billion-which-clinton-foundation-stole-from-its-relief-funds/
"We have been overrun by third world countries.  Enough is enough, we need a merit based system and an end to chain/lottery immigration.  Ted Kennedy promised 45 years ago when we opened immigration back up after 40 years of no immigration that we would not be overrun by third world countries.  What a disgrace!"
"You called Haiti a ""shithole country."" Nobody made that up. The people who heard you say it have been talking about it ever since. Paul Ryan couldn't even look at the TV camera when he said your words were not helpful."
"I think most of us knew what you were saying, and itâ€™s true about those Countries that their government clearly cares nothing for its people, sad but true.  We shouldnâ€™t have to be the ones taking care of them, but we have in the past and itâ€™s done no good because of their selfish run people in authority that only want the handouts and nothing more. We all feel for the less fortunate but we as a Country only get taken advantage of and nothing changes.  My Gosh why canâ€™t we take care of our own homeless,downtrodden, forgotten people first! Keep going Mr President, my view has not changed one bit, still on that train, but please do not flip flop on immigration, amnesty!"
"Haiti is a government that is drug cartel, people governed by way of their own superstions vodoo,kept under edducated,  kept super poor, living conditions horrible, its a sh**hole."

"The Clinton Foundation can still be made to 'support' (e.g. pay for} Haiti reconstruction.  Appoint a federal Special Master, total authority over all Clinton Foundation assets, and put Team Rubicon in charge of the reconstruction."
"Thank you President Trump for your honesty.  I do not want people in this country who are cowardly cockroaches unwilling to work to make their own country better.  It is a travesty to allow those cowardly immigrants into this country knowing that they will not contribute to its well being and suckle on the govâ€™t teat."
Not a bad idea to record. I would just hope that nothing derogatory was said. People are just looking for a reason to make you look bad rather than help and do good for the country.
"Mr. President, someone (story was ""unsourced"") set you up right in time for MLK day, so they could tear you apart all weekend and ignore all the Dossier news coming down.  Maybe they should ask the Clinton foundation about Haiti . . ."
Clinton took money meant for Haiti to improve the conditions. In all honesty the democraps don't care about Haiti. It is an unfortunate place to live but most places were made that way after colonization and corruption.
What the Clintons and their foundation did the Haitian people after the earthquake is what they should be talking about. They used it to enrich their friends and themselves.
The Clintons swooped into Haiti like vultures and are to blame for that poor country's continued despair!
"Zionist Clintons whom work to enrich Israel and Russia. ""As secretary of state Hillary blew away all the health care funds"". Hitchens. Arrest her now!!!"
"Hillary and her brother get a pass for ripping Haiti off!?!? Do whatever you have to, protect yourself from the desperate democrats as they die flaying about."
"Rumored words vs. actions.  The Clintons took millions of donations away from the Haitian people, and trafficked children out of the country.  Laura Silsby was caught trying to move 30 kids out of Haiti until Hillary bailed her out."
The Clinton Foundation fleeced Haiti of $$millions? contributing to the deteriorated infrastructure (making it a shithole) and the media is worried about what the President said?  I stand with the President.
The supporters of the president know what to expect from the media and the democrats.They have been doing this since he first started.Let them waste their time on making up lies. This country has really started to get better and there's one person to thank for it all our PRESIDENT.
Never mind the Clintons robbing Haiti Blind... and that Trump has donated over a million dollars to Haiti..yeah
Please document your suggestion that the Clintons robbed Haiti blind.
"Yes, start recording!!! Iâ€™d like to know who these â€œsourcesâ€ù are who come out of your office and speak hearsay. But then again, when was the last time anyone went to Haiti or certain parts of Africa for a restful vacation and not for humanitarian purposes?"

"Personally, Haiti does not give anything to the _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸ USA. Do not know what he actually said, but President Trump was  disgusted with the push, push no help Democrats. Probably fed up."
Itâ€™s really a shame how the democrats are behaving like extremely spoiled brats!  God knows exactly what they doing and what HIS will is.  I would think about the evil youâ€™re doing now.
Meanwhile France is keeping its mouth firmly shut. Donâ€™t anyone remind them that the most â€œprogressiveâ€ù nation in the world is responsible for the majority of Haitiâ€™s problems today. Shhhhh
You know. If you think about it..most of us call them 3rd world countries. So sh-thole countries is pretty much the same thing....just different wording.
I predicted yesterday this would be his statement. Whatâ€™s even more sad is that certain people will believe it as they are blind to his flaws. This man is unhinged.
"Why don't the Dems remember the Clintons in Haiti.  The hospitals that were supposed to be built by the Clinton Foundation, the 170 million that the Foundation promised to help restore the power plant...all they can remember is horse---t!"
Thatâ€™s why you called their country a shithole! Never do you take responsibility for anything except what you donâ€™t do!! You said it not the Dems..
You mean like the Clintons taking responsibility for all the millions they stole from Haiti to MAKE it a shithole.
John Smith has nothing to do with Clintonâ€™s they are not in office get over it! Did not like this man before he ran and sure canâ€™t stand him now!!
If you fly over Haiti it is a shÃ—thole. It was 100 percent developed by Haitians for Haitians .The Haitians live in they own SHÃ—t. They refuse to pick up their own trash. FLY over and see the way they choose to live.They are adults.
"It was a private, closed door meeting. No matter how one felt they should  of kept their mouth shut about it and not gone public. If you have a problem talk to the person who said it in private.

Haiti is a dying shithole. I see nothing wrong with saying that. Have any of you seen Haiti? Its worse than a 3rd world country lmao. But they need HELP idc what he said as long as he helps em out. Cause honestly we could just let then rot and the country would get worse everyday.

The people of Haiti were cheated big time by the Clinton foundation.  Makes me sick inside the Clintons have gotten away with their evil.
"This didn't come from just ""liberals"" if you think this kind of talk is good for our country in any way shape or form, or condone it...you are the problem!"
"Call it like you see it.  Mr. President, that's why we hired you. Funny thing is you wouldn't take our money but you work harder than anyone else for our country!_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸"
"the congregants of the First Haitian Baptist Church of Pompano Beach, FL prayed for you this morning for a change of heart re: our country Haiti and the other countries you misspoke about."
"You could make things so easy by shutting your mouth, staying off Twitter and letting the Investigations happen. You claim to be so innocent, then prove it. As of now, all you do is prove Fire and Furry to be true. Your words and actions affirm every bit of that book and the dossier. And your rants are those of a delusional criminal."
Exactly that book PROVES everything we smart people know about him.
Try telling his sheeple supporters. They are too busy fondling to Hannity to have a clue of REALITY
"Eric Egnor Congratulations! You have just proven yourself to be one of the stupidest, and most ignorant dumbasses on the entire planet! First, President Trump is letting the ridiculous and baseless investigations happen, and all that is being uncovered by them is more proof of treason and crimes against your hero criminal Democrats. Second, it's not up to him to prove his innocence... this is still America, where people are innocent until proven guilty. Pretty funny how you don't expect known and renowned criminals like useless pile of sh*t obama and career criminal hillary to prove their innocence, despite the mountains of actual evidence that proves their guilt and compliance in countless crimes. Third, every single word of that ridiculous book has already been discredited as unsubstantiated bullsh*t... even by your favorite peddlers of fake news, CNN. Truly, you are a brainwashed zombie who has absolutely no clue as to what a fact is, nor do you have any interest in educating yourself on facts vs fiction. Idiotic libtards like you are the biggest problem this country has, and your stupidity is only surpassed by your blind ignorance!  #MAGA"
"Profound in his vision, confident in his command, peerless in his patriotism, President DONALD J. TRUMP is the world's premier statesman. The present situation in our country is yet another clear testimony to the wisdom and justice of President DONALD J. TRUMP's line of simultaneously developing economic construction and improving our defence capacity and the policy of making the US military a cadre army, strengthening it, and effectively arming the entire people and fortifying the whole country with a border wall, travel restrictions, and merit-based immigration policies. Today, our great nation can adhere to founding principles without being affected by foreign threats and blackmail, because it has, by its own effort, built a powerful defence capacity which has the strength to defend the security of the country and the gains of democracy, by hard struggle and strenuous efforts under the wise direction of the leaders in the past. If we had not built up our own strength but relied on the strength of others, we would have been in a very difficult position, in fact, we would have been incapable of stubbornly resisting the enemy in the serious situation we now face. We should have great pride and the confidence to continue with the implementation of the self-defensive military line of our nation, and thereby strengthen the defensive power of the People still further, and if the enemy dares to invade us, we should fight bravely, thereby once again demonstrating to the whole world the invincible might of the heroic American people rallied in single-hearted unity around our outstanding President DONALD J. TRUMP!"
How to try and bend the truth Donnie. The blind faithful stand behind you. Keep them fighting and keep them distracted .  How are those Carrier and coal mining jobs coming. Don't forget you promised to help Wisc. Dairy farmers. Oh that's right. Not pulling out of NAFTA now.  Oh ok. Get back to building that wall. Ladder stocks going thru the roof. Ha ha ha ha ha
Are you talking about mainstream media that only knows how to bend the truth. Really do you expect him to achieve all he wants to in such a short time??? Face it heâ€™s done more in 1 year the Obama did in 8!
His own people said he did it. The man is a fool. A rich fool. A man full of hatred. That's not what America stands for. The worst President in history in first year. A joke to the world. Once again. The spaceship is behind the comet.
"blame the clintons from not sending the help back when they promised it !!we cannot and should not bail every country out that is destroying their people,their governments are responsible for them ,NOT US"
"The MSM doesnâ€™t give a crap about Haiti, they all know the Clintonâ€™s stole their money for food and shelter and made themselves more wealthy at their expense. Then they pretend to be offended over words. Love Trumpâù_ï¸è"
"Don't talk about what the crooked Clinton's did with the money it was to go to Haiti victims, it went to their crooked foundation instead. Oh No, you won't talk about that, you are haters & ever so Evil!!!!!"
"I donâ€™t know if Trump made those comments or not....unfortunately the media is just as corrupt as the politicians now and Trump has successfully muddied the waters enough so he can now say anything he wants and then deny it if it proves to be unpopular.Regarding the alleged remarks....people generally emigrate for a better life than the one they have got which is how America came to exist. It is still a very young country and is still developing and maybe one day it will be as culturally rich as Europe, Africa and Asia. They donâ€™t have large numbers of Scandinavians wanting to move to America because the Scandinavians donâ€™t want a decrease in their standard of living, health and education.....Norway, Sweden etc are far superior to the US so why would their citizens want to leave for something worse?"
When will we see Bill and Hillary in Jail... cone on Donald get these pair Jailed for life for what they have done to Haiti alone never mind anything else.... wonder what the leftist types think of there antics in Haiti?
The media is becoming the worst enemy of the state. They are fabricating and lying about facts daily. They have zero accountability and uncontrollable vindictiveness. Maybe it's time to limit their access until they learn how to report impartially without bias.
Like that would happen. We can _Ÿ™è_Ÿ™è_Ÿ™è for it though. _Ÿ‘ç
"It has gotten to the point where you can only criticize  one country without blowback.  Universities teach disrespect and condemnation of only one country.  Religious freedom is tolerated except for one religion.  People are equal regardless of race or gender - except for one race.  What the hell is going on? Is the United States the kicking boy?  Regarding Haiti,  I visited Haiti too in the '70's when they called themselves Little Africa and voodoo was open..  It was a port for cruise ships for many years.  Papa Doc took it down and Baby Doc finished stripping it.  Nature all but erased it.  The people have a resolve and work ethic despite it all."
"""Made up by Dems"" then why are Republicans from the same meeting not denying you said this as well? YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON DENYING IT. You're a liar and an embarrassment on this country."
"even if he did so what, it is true."
"So what: This is yet another example of how this president lies to the public and knows that if he asserts a lie hard enough, his supporters will believe him. Also, when you are the president, HOW you say things matter. You create more issues for yourself if you have a lack of nuance. This man completely lacks nuance."
"What about the rest..."" Take em out, and he prefers more people from Norway and Asian countries. Perhaps we should change the wording on the Statue of Liberty."
Who cares.  Oh yea people that jump at every thing he says and does.   You ever see commercials for trips to Haiti.   Nope ya know why.  Itâ€™s a s### hole
20% turds need some SORE BUTT SALVE!! You libtards should research what the evil clintons & their  contractors did to Haiti after the earthquake....._Ÿ˜_ better yet ask any Haitian. #GetTheTruth #Ignoramus'
"Funny that democrats and media had no qualm with Obama on live TV calling certain residents of a state Rednecks. Hypocrite much? And get your facts straight, he referenced a country's livable condition, not people who lived there but you hypocrites try to spin things to fit your narrative."
"Everyone needs to grow up and remember what our smart mammas told us when we were young. ""Sticks and stones can break our bones, but words will never hurt us"". Isn't it sad that so many people have become so emotionally weak that words hurts them so much? Was it wrong if he said ""shithole""? Yes. but get over it."
"He owns everything he says no matter how crass, so if he says he didn't say that I believe him. Democrats would never make up something like that, nooo."
You need to start taking responsibility for your action jess go back to your history you will learn what Haiti has done for your country and I donâ€™t blame I blaming your parents
"It's Strange how you have a ""great relationship"" with other countries but your own. Stop blaming other people for the things you say and do. Your your own worst enemy."
"Unlike the crooked, corrupt, OBUMMER, this President tells the truth."
What truth? How exploits women have a Tic Tac and grabbed a pussy that's the truth
What you doing and saying is called Blind following
Gary Coppedge like Hillary or Bernie are such great people please if you voted for them it tells me more about you.
Fortunately I didn't vote for either party because in my heart I believed them all to be scam artist. Trump make a even worst president due to him continuously to mislead people. And as a woman you should feel some kind of way to have that he the person you respect as a person has no respect for you your daughter your mother your aunt your sister your grandmother great-grandmother so forth and so on
"Trump is right!, no matter how he said it!..We are not the world's ""Salvation Army""!.The liberal frenzy about the term $hithole is a distraction from a booming economy and growing evidence of conspired treason by Clinton and top FBI officials that had an ""insurance policy"" to subvert our election."
"Where do you people get this stuff? You guys go through the day making things up as you go along. Trump has a problem respecting other people, culture, traditions and religious beliefs. He's a hateful individual with no conscious. When he speaks he lies and does it with a straight face. If you have a mother, or wife, a daughter, grandmother you need to protect them because Trump is on the Loose and he's hands are free and he's passing laws to do as he pleased to anyone."
"Gary Coppedge thankfully, we the people do not use your delirious thinking, when it comes to our right to vote! God bless President Trump and team!"
"Truthfully Mr President, we think your comments yesterday were RIGHT ON! And hilarious too! Why does this country have to populate itself with the poorest and the beggars from other nations?"
"Who cares what people say, trump? Keep doing what you do and the voices of those under the republican shoe will die off soon enough...."
_Ÿ˜_
"True!!! After all of the millions and millions of dollars we sent to aid Haiti reconstruct, it is exactly as it was before. WHERE did the money go to?  WHO actually got the kickbacks????"
You are a sad excuse for a human being & an embarrassment to our country.  You don't belong in that office.  You do not represent the majority of us.
"I donâ€™t think you said anything wrong. If those Countries werenâ€™t what you labeled them, people wouldnâ€™t be leaving in droves."
Lorrie the stupid jersey girl speaks.
I love how the Demacratic party and their followers like chaos. Instead of telling their Reps to start working together they rather sit back and let them just act like thugs and cry I donâ€™t have the power so we need to keep bashing instead of getting off the couch and working together. Maybe if you try honestly try to work this country can move on. Something has to change and I am not talking about the diapers of all these cry baby Dems shut up and help with solutions and stop being the problem.
"thank you Mr President for being real, honest, open and fearless. there are many among us that easily offended, as if they never spoke a harsh word or cursed another in their lives...I always see the character defects in others that are really the ones I dislike about myself...you know, the old saying point a finger ya got three pointing back at ya. thank you God for President Trump...âù£"
"Think of it this way. POTUS speaks his mind and is open and honest. Better than what 44, 43, 42, have always said what you want here and turn around in the same breath and do just the opposite. Why people complain about his tweets. He's open and honest and he so far has done what he said he would do. The fake media doesn't like it because they can't spin the message."
_Ÿ˜__Ÿ‘è_Ÿ‘è_Ÿ‘è
"Haiti is a dump truth be told.  Maybe one day these 3rd world countries like Haiti will improve, but it gonna take a really long time, maybe in a couple more hundred years."
"Agree with Trump it's the countries and NOT the people, so true!!!!! What about CNN calling them 3rd world what's that???????? Whatever they say is ok!!!!!!!"
Haiti is really corrupt and the people are in poverty that is a fact...get over yourselves democraps. The are going to Chile...check it out.
"First thing.  America did not colonize Haiti if you want to blame a country for Haiti's condition blame  France, in 1791 there was slave uprising and the french tuck their tail between their legs and sailed into the sunrise.  It seems like every disaster America is required to run to the rescue.  If I remember correctly after receiving US Aid about six million dollars  an elaborate estate popped up out of nowhere and other private projects.  Why is America responsible for what some other country left Haiti to rot."
"What!  No international comment or from the anti-Trump groupies.  I guess it was okay for another country to do things in the past, but if it was America there would be riots today for what happened an d there were slaves."
The mainstream media should be talking about where all the millions of dollars went that was given to help the people of Haiti.  Millions given to the Clinton Foundation to help the people of Haiti after the earthquake.   Where did it go?  I think we all know.  But the mainstream media won't talk about that.  And we won't forget Hillary called all of us Trump supporters deplorable!
"Still has my Vote in 2020. Cause I'm pretty sure alot worse has been said by the Democrats an few Republicans sitting in that room, but if we can Bash Trump let's do it.  Trump 2020"
_Ÿ‘ç_Ÿ‘ç_Ÿ‘ç
"Thank you President Trump for all that you are doing for our country, small business and protecting us. I donâ€™t listen to the media or the haters,neither should you! USAâù_ï¸è"
Thank you President Trump.  Don't let the media get to you.  You are doing a great job.  You are the first President in a long time that puts the people first.   You are loved by many.... Keep focused on that and your making America Great Again.
Amen.
"Much better protocol to smile, wave, say nice things, while embezzling as much money as you can (30 million) from the shithole country, right Clinton Foundation?"
"Because the Clinton's took all the money along with their crooked friends that would have rebuilt their country and made life a little better for them.  Well, that's one reason their country is poor.  I'm sure there are leaders there living high on the hog, stealing from the people. Sad."
"Obviously the Dems in that meeting had no interest in coming to a solution that will put Americans first and help clean up DACA, Visas, Chain Migration.  SAFETY FIRST!"
No doubt.
Why am i not surprised by his denial. He's a horrible horrible President and person. This country is only gonna get worse for the nxt 3 years. God help is all! Smdh._Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ˜¡
Itâ€™s CNN particularly Don lemon last night there should be some type of way to protect what is said he created that it was a racial thing no itâ€™s not itâ€™s horrible country itâ€™s filthy and very poorly run and the people are very poorly treated. But CNN needs to be dealt with how they handled the news theyâ€™re not only one-sided theyâ€™re very critical and cruel.â™¥ï¸è_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸â™¥ï¸è
"I think you referred to ""shithole countries"".  I don't necessarily disagree with your characterization, but I don't think you helped yourself or the country with your declaration.  Please learn to control your lips."
"POTUS , Mr Trump, please be careful of what you say and tweet as your enemies are hanging on every whisper from you to distroy you, please don't use colorful language and anecdotes because the lying media will turn this on you , be very careful in , talking, actions and body language because the right does no work anymore all they do is campaign against you."
"The democrats are the liars. Look at Hillary, perfect example. Theyâ€™re going to spread their lies about you every chance they get. Theyâ€™ve lost so the only thing they can do is continue to try to make you look bad. Keep making America great!"
_Ÿ‘ç
Africa and Haiti are shitholes. Why do you think their citizens flee and come to America?  You don't see Americans moving to Haiti.
"Haiti is a country where I feel that I'm Haitian, every week there are so many foreigners who have come to Haiti to spend their vacation, abroad is the old Haiti image that we sell for it."
"Some unnamed ""someone"" says that they heard another unnamed ""someone"" say that they heard President Trump say [fill in the blank] and the media treats it like it's actual news. So tired of this. Anonymous=invalid. Either name the original sources, let them come out in the open and tell it to our faces, or just admit that you made it up for ratings, CNN."
"Prior to 2010, Haiti was celebrating mass ""Voodoo satanic worship"" country wide.  This is not a way to live, Look at the devastation....annihilating earthquakes, hurricanes that completely destroy....."
"President Trump continue to play these people like a banjo.... continue strumming those strings so we all can see their true colors. The problem is they (Dems and Liberals) have been fed so many lies, deception, smoke and mirrors from the past administration for 8 years that they don't know what the truth looks or sounds like anymore."
"Let any Haitian in front of a MSM camera, and ask them about the Clintons..that would shut them up fast, but they never ever ask any Haitians anything, because they will tell the truth."
Part of the reason Haiti is in a mess is because of the US government agencies handling of relief for the Haitian people.  DRAIN THE SWAMP!
"Poor Puerto Rico. Sad for those people. S-l-o-w response from U.S. Gov't there too. That whole corrupt electrical grid contract deal! That fell off the radar screen, those folks are STILL without regular electrical power. How you going to pump gas, or run a home or hospital, etc."
"And the lying, cheating, stealing and running of the US resources on the local black markets doesn't help."
"You got that right President Trump, You know everything you say will be turned around the opposite against you by the Democrats, You can not Trust anyone to get it right so best to record everything you say. God Bless you and i think you are doing a great job."
"The African Union, group of Haitian American diplomats wants Pres Trump to apology for an alleged used of the word, Sh*thole to described a place stricken by crime, corruptions, injustice, inequality, and so forth. ... ???... Simply answer. No. It is their responsibility as well as Haitian diplomats, leaders, and people to help Haitian and their homeland from the dire situation they are in. These Haitian American diplomats should have resources and Haiti should have had their donations. Perhaps these Haitian American diplomats played a part of the fraud and thief of relief donations for Haiti. I read their letter in the DML article posted. Let get one thing clear. Although it is true that the USA is diverse and embrace different race and creed, it is up to each and every country responsibility and accountability to hold themselves, their culture, their people, their values, their compassion and embrace diversity, all race, all creed, all religion, and so forth to the highest standard.When immigrants first came here they came from hardship, countries with little resources, care for them, prejudice against their belief in God, prejudice against their status. They build a society and establish a form of government. In order to grow, they had to work hard and care for the country and people as well as for themselves and their families. They embrace different race and creed who also held the same high standards and care for this country and its people. America has always been compassionate, sympathy, supportive, and giving to many countries and providing many with means to make a better life for themselves. We are all immigrants and dreamers. During the civil wars, world wars, civil rights movement and even now, here in the USA and abroad to foreign countries, we fought for rights, freedom, liberty, pursuit of happiness - not given of happiness - PURSUIT of happiness without prejudice, discrimination, assault, violence, false accusations, and corruption by ANYONE. After WWII, Eleanor Roosevelt, UN Ambassador from the USA established immigration due process for those who dire poverty-stricken countries lack financial resources to provide resources for their people due to debt of war, war-stricken, famine, until countries could get back on its feet. She made it clear that this immigration due process was not to be taken advantage of by any individual or country here or abroad and that each country is still responsible and accountability for their own affairs of state, their people, their financial situation, their country. The immigrants here are responsible for their own pursuit of happiness and pledge alliance to this country in return. Immigrants, like those in the past, are obligated to supporting the people and the country of the USA. Immigration status was revoked if immigrants did not compile. Today, we have received millions of people who do not have the same high standards and seek to make this establish country their own with their own bad intentions and agenda. Because of this we, the American People, which includes all American immigrants from different cultural, race, religion, and status backgrounds, to restore legal immigration due process and status, revoked those who threaten this great country, return to law and order, reestablish our form of government, and rebuild and provide for our country and our people first rightfully. Today, there should be many countries who now have the resources, traits, skills, knowledge, diversity, shared information, research, and knowledge, and resourceful and productive leaders to make their own country great, providing for their own people first. The USA also looks to ever country for their own diverse culture, race, creed, language, knowledge, skills, inventions, resources, traits, trades, and information as we have done so for hundreds of years. Today, many foreign countries abuse their relationship with the USA by allowing to shift the responsibility of their people upon the USA. If other foreign countries, leaders, diplomats, and ambassadors truly care about the USA, they would not allow lies, bigotry, corruptions, false accusations, propaganda, violation of constitutional freedom, rights, and liberty, illegal violation and abused of federal and constitutional laws and due process, and terrorism for the past 8 yrs or so to ruin and destroy the integrity of the USA. I do believe these American Haitian diplomats should spend more time helping their people and countries to rebuild and move forward. I also believe they should spend time going after those individuals who have mismanaged and stolen money donated to them to rebuild and improve the lives of their people and ask them to apologize to the people of Haiti.Unfortunately, they have been and are part of the problem and corruption."
Build the Wall and put it where the border patrol people say itâ€™s needed and in the same  bill deal with Daca so that problem STOPS.  Must end chain migration. We must take care of our own. Americanâ€™s who have worked here all their life need to be cared for before anyone else. Period _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
"thank you Mr. President..... for speaking the truth. these countries are shitholes.... all we do now is take in these people ,they get on gov. assistence and never get off or assimilate. we send millions of dollars in aid to these countries and the money never gets to the people who need help... cut all foreign aid. years ago when our great grand parents came to this country  they worked!!!  there was no gov. assistence back then...... now it is all about coming here and getting on the backs of hard working americans. here's a thought... stop all immigration period for minimum of 10 years,all foreign aid and let's take care of americans first"
Donâ€™t worry Mr President! If youâ€™d say it. Youâ€™ll not be wrong! As Haitian Iâ€™ll understand your message to us. We are a shiethole country with shiethole politics without progressist mind! Nothing wrong if you said it!
"All of you people complaining about the ""shitholes"" comment...Take your next vacation there and contribute to the economy, hypocrites..."
"Haiti has been poor so long that people won't lift a hand to improve their own neighborhoods,it seems ingrained now.  Our Church group went down to build a building for a clinic that a missionary was running.  All of the concrete had to be mixed by hand.  When the mission construction team asked if any of the many villagers observing the project wanted to pitch in and help, they asked how much they would be paid.  Not willing to lift a hand to help build their village clinic unless they were paid but willing let the foreigners to buy all the materials and labor to build it for them. Not much hope left there, its why they risk their lives to come here."
We don't need Haitians here.  Tell them thing might be better for them if they didn't slaughter the French that created Haiti.  The US has PAID and REBUILT Haiti 3 times since they slaughtered the French founders.  Not our problem.
"Yes, record all meetings. Release them to the public, with sensitive data omitted for national security reasons of course. Excellent idea. Then the loser Dems can't lie like they keep doing. Disgraceful! They've been talking about nothing but the 'shithole' comment for like 18 hours straight!  There's other news about the great things you're doing and we need to hear that too!"
Yes please do record them and then we can see how much the PUSSY GRABBER LIES his FAT face off!
Lorrie Janine - you're just bitter your candidate lost. Nothing more. So bitter. Bad. Bad for 'Murica.
"Lorrie Janine Trump is right!, no matter how he said it!..We are not the world's ""Salvation Army""!.The liberal frenzy about the term $hithole is a distraction from a booming economy and growing evidence of conspired treason by Clinton and top FBI officials that had an ""insurance policy"" to subvert our election..lol"
"You canâ€™t win with Dems!   So why are you caving to them on DACA?   They only want it so they canâ€™t get millions of new voters to get back the White House, Congress and eventually the Supreme Court!   Why canâ€™t you see this?   Youâ€™re being set up to fail.   No DACA!   Send refugees back!  The longer they stay, theyâ€™re having children and we taxpayers keep footing the bill.    Weâ€™ve had enough!!"
Haiti is a shithole..  My god.. Grow up...  Dick Durbin is a idiot and all you PC  liberal cry babies are right there with him..  They called me a bad name..  WHAAAAAAA.. Keep the negative lying crap going.. It worked so well last election..  Stock market hits new high again!!   MAGA!!
I hate the media and all the hate that they spread. Can't go 1 day without them twisting something or just flat out lying. Or paying people somebody to say something that suits their hatred. So lame
It's sad. The guy can't even go to a health check without people flipping out. He has no filter and the need for political correctness- probably something we've needed for a very long time.
100% agree Megan!!!!!
They said you called it a shithole country. Probably haiti agrees but the media doesn't care about that.
"please fire sessions and legalize cannabis and fix the shitholes in our country,,dont let some socialist steal youre thunder...."
"People who get it, realize you don't have to be articulate to know what you are doing!  Thats all they have...  Keep On keeping on, Mr. President!  Don't let the hypocrites get too you! Be you!  You dont have to be a ""classic"" president to do a great job.  Dems need to get over themselves!"
"You have lied so often (over 2,000 since you have been elected , Claiming Obama made the decision on the London embassy is easy to check (it was Bush, not Obama).  It has become the infamous story of the boy who cried wolf.  You are a domestic and international laughing stock."
"Ha!!  Absolutely brilliant on President Donald J. Trump's part. If he actually said this, it drives the point straight home to the Clintons!  Now, the pressure is on them to explain why over $2 billions in donations NEVER made it to Haiti. We all know they are the corrupt Clinton Crime Family. But don't take my word for it. Just ask the Haitians."
"Haiti in not a part of the United States. We have no governmental obligations to provide them any assistance. However, spiritually, we should do good for all."
Record All meetings please - Demo/Liberals always take cheap shots to make look bad their Standard Operating Procedure.  Someday they will grow up and stop the lies. I wouldn't hold my breath on it though.
You are a well-documented liar. No one should believe a word you say. Shut up and go golfing and leave governance to the grown ups.
Grown ups like Barrack the muslim John Woodruff jr? What a joke. Trump told the truth. As a liberal you cant stan d the truth. But this much IS TRUE. He is president .
"Trump is not president until he shows us his birth certificate. If you want to pitch â€˜em, you have to catch a few."
"You also denied the "" grab them by the puss*"".Keep on insulting since its the only thing you and your stupid supporters are capable of.We just consider you as an unhappy old  and mentally sick person. Play the clown for the 3 years to come, we don't really care.#GnamogodÃ©n"
"you probably say things like that because you are afraid he will send you  "" home """
"Lol send me home? Dear Trumpanzee, I'm already at home"
Hamed SidibÃ© Or 'in' the home?
"Arianna KM  in , on or above...I'm happy here and I'm not led by an irresponsible old guy. Lol"
"A very articulate father who adopted two children from Haiti was interviewed on the radio. He stated that throughout the adoption process he visited Haiti 4 times. The adoption agency warned him in advance that the country was a ""Hell hole."" They needed to prepare themselves to see a country without an educational system, 80% unemployment, $2/hr  wages, trash everywhere, extreme poverty where everybody is trying to get out. Trump used an inappropriate adjective, and certainly sounded unpresidential, but unfortunately wasn't wrong."
What happened to all the money that the Clintons raised to help Haiti?
Supposedly 94% went to their foundation with 6% helping relief.  :(
"I'm sure you already know this but Democrats--and quite a few Republicans--have virtually no character or integrity. The only way one can negotiate or work with such individuals is to make them feel--and fear--pain. Best of luck, Mr. President. You have pleasantly surprised me."
"So Trump didn't say what a democrat senator told a Washington Post ""reporter""  he said. It's a white dem trying to go back to the worn out race card, again. Dems are pissed the Dow is heading to 26,000 and people are keeping more of their own money."

"I am an American and you are my President. I admit ...I don't always like how you say things, I personally think that a little more discernment in word choice would be benificial to our country, however with thst being said, I would still rather have a President who is the same weather the cameras are on or off...not be one way to the public while selling our country out for his own gain"
"After the thievery from certain high ranking Democrat individuals of the Haitian fund.. they are just trying to put you in a bad Haitian light by twisting your words.

"I stand with Trump over all the crazed media, democrats and liberals!  The best President we've ever had and all you crazies look for something to be offended by!"
"Me president, we donâ€™t care what you said about Haiti.  It is a a hole country and besides,  we have enough pro football players, who donâ€™t stand for the national anthem."
What an awful democrat that said terrible things about Haiti then blamed it on Our President . Trump should make that guy our ambassador
"it's really sad that our President Donald J. Trump has to be ridiculed like this...even if he did say it, its the truth...there are some really chitty countries, some that even want to kill us...Please let him do his job and stop all this petty nonsense!"
"If you think about it why would trump even mention Haiti . I think I know why.He opened a can of worms I think . Smart man"
He mentioned Africa too. Africa where the U.S. has 15+ military bases. Nothing like putting  the lives of all the service men and women who are stationed there at risk! He is PATHETIC!
Sh-thole liberal Democrats have no business being in your meetings..they will use every word you speak against you in the liberal Sh-thole media.
"Recording future meetings is probably a good idea. You've got a traitor somewhere in the WH, so you need to keep a recorder in your pocket at all times, not just in meetings. MSM will always try to find a way to turn things around on you. #MAGA"

"Coming from someone who says Al Franken is a role model, your opinion is not warranted."
You  HEARD him????  When and how did you hear him?  As far as I know  NO ONE  who was in that meeting has verified that accusation!!!
"Sharon Barger, WRONG.  It has been confirmed by Sen. Durbin who was  in the room at the time,  and tRUMP used the term repeatedly.  Also present were Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the majority leader; Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia; Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas; and Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.Although none of the Republican lawmakers would comment, no one DENIED the comment made by tRUMP."
Where is the money theCl inton Foundation  gave to Hati Shay Goldberg. Oh I forgot she is a woman and a DEMOCRAT so we cant talk about that.
"Bill Faulconer , when you're unable to comment on the topic at hand, you deflect.  LOLOL!  TYPICAL . . ."
"All that clinton foundation monies at work. Well Trump may not be perfect. But sure beats criminal embezzlers. Given up his salary. Net worth has gone down. So thank you Mr. Trump for your service. Let's audit all our elect. Find out how they can own multi million dollar homes ect..  on their 150,000 dollar average salaries."
I lived in central america for 5years while my husband did the permanent resident.He is now an american citizen.you dont dare want to go there youll either be kidnapped or murdered or held for ransom We kissed the ground when we returned back to the states
"So sorry attacking is main agenda... ... many across the nation were disturbed over a few ""bombs"" in the past. Some caught by cameras...shame the real reason is overlooked...just don't like who won the election.  Love seeing the improvements many are experiencing all across America."
"Nope you just said â€œwhy are we bringing in people from â€œshithole countriesâ€ùâ€ùI for one am saddened by the lack of empathy and awareness by our president. Hope he gets the boot soon."
"The countries in question meet the description--for many many reasons.  That's why their people are desperate to flee.  The comment would usually apply to corrupt governments and horrendous living conditions, not the people who are trying to escape.  It's a blunt description, coarse,  undiplomatic, but accurate. Most of these horrendous places couldn't be summarized better in two words.."
Clintonâ€™s were supposed to help Haiti _Ÿ‡__Ÿ‡_ and they never did somebody that lived there and went to a church and said that he received no help for his people and that is disgusting because they were deviates by hurricane
".... I wouldn't be mad even if you did say it. Truth doesn't care about feelings, and the truth is Haiti is an awful place across the board. Several unsavory phrases are necessary in classifying Haiti properly, and most of these people that are upset wouldn't stay a week in Haiti on purpose for pleasure. Maybe a missions trip or humanitarian outreach, but not just to go. None of these Democrat senators or representatives would even fly over Haiti..."
"Haiti, Africa and the middle East are shitholes.. Then they came here and demolished Chicago, Detroit, LA etc.. see a common denominator??"
So our #45 can speak filth about them...and we BECOME related to them also in the eyes of our Allies....that what you want. Ernie Baldovino?
"Donna if he did say that and I'm not agreeing that he did. It was behind closed doors and not in a public setting.

"Every day, by your ""so many words"" and actions you are turning the United States and the USA reputation, worldwide, into a ""sh**hole"".  MAGA ... Resign!"
Please read the United States State Department warning on Travel to Haiti on their website before you make up your mind. It basically says you are taking your life in hands if you travel there.
"Granted, the president needs a filter.  But want to add that I have several clients who have come from Haiti. All lovely, educated and hard-working people that I am pleased to have known. And even they will tell you that Haiti is a disaster.  It is not a reflection on its residents. Just a poorly worded description of what exists there."
Keep doing the good job.  u re doing. a lot of the problems u have is because other President did not do there job and just passed thing down the line.   If they dont like your language so what they can leave then.  Keep up the good work. Charity starts at home any way.  other s should not be here any way
"Mr. President, why are we putting up with the vulgar and vile trashmouths that slander you and our administration daily? Of course it starts with the media. I understand they're incredibly bitter sore losers, but at what point does free speech become dangerous and treasonous?"
Well they will just have to get over it. Can't go back have to move forward. Should it have been said in a public format. Probably not but you did speak the truth.  Your every move will be scrutinized by the Social Democrats. Anyone including a traditional liberal like myself is criticized by them if you think for yourself they are a bunch of socialist. Keep working hard and moving forward Mr. President that is all you can do.
El Che decÃ_a confÃ_a pero controla aunque en ocasiones hay que esperar los tiempos de Dios y con HaitÃ_ se puede contar o no? Yo tuve un estudiante de ese paÃ_s caprichoso pero muy inteligente jajajajajajaja
"No one here saw, heard him say it. CNN said it over and over. The media pool is a shithole. The country's mentioned are mostly shitholes. If said, nothing fake spoken.Remember the liberals say they are welcome here because there home is a shithole. Now someone else might have said it. Gasp!!!!"
"even if you did say something about Haiti, you are an American taxpayer and have free speech. liberals say and do vile things yet free speech protects them"
"Not only did Clintons sell 20% of America's Uranium to Russia. Look what they did to Haiti who has 100,000 still living in tents from 2010 earthquake ,  Hurricanes .Hillary Clintonâ€™s brother, Tony Rodham, landed a lucrative and historically rare Haitian â€œgold exploitation permit,â€ù while Clinton Foundation donors, including Digicel mobile phone company founder Denis Oâ€™Brien, were winning multimillion dollar contracts that would siphon massive profits from the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.â€œI deal through the Clinton Foundation,â€ù Tony Rodham said, according to a transcript of his testimony during court proceedings obtained by The New York Times. â€œThat gets me in touch with the Haitian officials. I hound my brother-in-law [Bill Clinton], because itâ€™s his fund that weâ€™re going to get our money from. And he canâ€™t do it until the Haitian government does it.â€ù I support President Donald J. Trump 100%"
"How in the world can Hilary comment at all regarding Haiti!!  She stole from them and pocketed all the Earthquake Relief $$$!  The Clintons are heartless, ruthless, and need to GO TO JAIL!!!"
Exactly!
"They have said much worse ...Be glad when they release all of Hellarys emailsAnd her trollsâ€™ words ... the left is ridiculous and no one is listening except Rachel Madcow fiction fans.. ugh Trump 2020âù_ï¸è_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸"
"Libtards never want to say anything that might offend someone they believe they are better than.  Ever notice that?  If they feel like they're superior to someone, that someone has to be protected by the libtards from everyone else.  It's like they're trying to defend their favorite pet."
Of he said this he was just speaking the truth they are corrupt countries  that should be pushed out of office but thier not
those places economically socially and technogly wise aren't thriving. where's the lie? lol democrats trying to smear the Trump name is the biggest lie in history. just look at the major cities where Democrats are in charge Detroit for example a real bad area. Chicago too!
We all know this is about mass immigration vs. Visas from other countries being held back or denied. The past system needs to be repaired. The worst part is giving privileges and benefits to those who invade our illegally by the millions.
I bet the Haitians already knew before Trump made this announcement.   I bet so did all the other countries.   No big deal.
Why would anyone trust you? You lie all the time and then you try to pretend you didn't. Of course there is no trust; trust is earned and you failed to do that.
Suck it up 'cup-cake!'
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
64 million trust him. You aren't the only one in the room
the media lies terribly about the man! Jude bc he is uncovering all the corruption in our government ......... GODS will be done
"yada, yada, yada"
"Why would anyone trust the Libtard's after they tried to fix the election and they thought they had won the election even before it was over, LOL , They are the most corrupt politician's in the US and they cry when they can't have there own way, Like you crying , get over it, he is your POTUS  , just wait and see as the """"""TRUMP TRAIN """""" is going to drain the """"""SWAMP"""" and """"""MAGA"""" . Got to love these """"""SNOWFLAKES"""""""".And another thing it is getting old you stupid Libtard's and your """"""Ideology""""."
So Haiti is flourishing?
Jude is fake news
"Personally, I could careless if that term was used.  I do care who the lil traitors are that keep spreading lies/truths about what is happening behind presidential doors and in closed meetings.  Those folks need to be found and removed."
"I think this negativity and fault-finding from the news should not be reported.  What happened to press requiring proof before printing or running a story.   Freedom of speech yes, but where is the pride in their craft if they have no backing or source before they pour it out to the masses?"
"You canâ€™t work with dems, they donâ€™t want whatâ€™s best for America. The wall is already law. Build it. Enforce immigration law, you donâ€™t need to negotiate with dems to enforce the law."
One of the Dems ran out of the meeting yelling the President said a bad word.
"Mr. President, stop trying to explain to these liberal Dems  what you say. I don't believe a word they say. Just trying to  under mind your agenda.   So sad  that some people  like tearing down this wonderful country."
"Michigan Chrysler plant just announced a 2,000.00 bonus to ALL workers, plus 2500 new jobs for them CEO said it's due to new tax reform. Would you take a pay increase if your company offered it?"
Laundering money from a charity organization meant for Haiti may hurt my bones but words  never will.
Where did the billions that Haiti received after the 2010 earthquake have ended? Why are they still poor? And you allow yourself to criticize Trump _Ÿ˜‚
"It amazes me that there is absolutely no substance to an argument with some democrats. Talk about policy and they have no clue. I heard a lady in a waiting room say to her friend, I cannot wait until ""we"" impeach Trump. Curious to see what she would say. I asked, who would be president if he was impeached? Wait for it.... yes.... Hillary.After my eyes finished rolling around in my head I decided to let it go. I said, as we in the south know means ( too stupid for words) bless your heart."

"A s---hole is not defined by its people, but by its government. Typically a third world, corrupt government like one that would use the FBI, DOJ and IRS to secure power for the ruling progressive party."
Like Obama & Hillary did for 8 yrs.
Wonder if MSM will offer an apology as it was another no named source and they tried the same thing on you 2 weeks ago. Journalism is a joke these days. #maga
Not one good reason to explain yourself...for some the truthful words hurt and those people are incapable of dealing with it...Thank You for your Hard work and continued fight for the American people
"Ummm, Iâ€™m confused. You said â€˜shithole countriesâ€™,not â€˜take them outâ€™. Funny how you didnâ€™t deny saying shithole countries. But then again most of what you say is _Ÿ™„."
"We the deplorable's know what you met the communist media is wetting all over themselves.  Keep up the good work your doing a great job. Side note: Bill Clinton, George Bush and Obama did the fund raiser after the Haitian earthquake the people only got a small amount the funds went to the organiser with most right into the Clintion Foundation to fund Crooked Hillary's presidential run! Makes me very angry to think the donation I sent to help went to thoughs crooks (never again)."
"keep records and know what you say before you say it, he was referring to a preference of immigrants from Norway because the country has the highest success rate in education that is true and Haiti is a very poor country any country seeking refuge obviously has problems and he wants to build a better America because its where his love is and his home is where his heart is"
We normal people know what you meant Mr President my dad would have said it that way too. It is a bad place full of devil worship and and blight itâ€™s the countryâ€™s fault. They need to change. But their leaders wonâ€™t.
"Please donâ€™t back away from this.  The politically correct and well groomed political speak has brought about no changes in our immigration policy and behavior.  Saying that things are a mess does not get peopleâ€™s attention.  If we do not take control of this situation the immigration problem will go away, because we will become the â€œshithole.â€ù  Let the image settle and take hold."
"That needs auditing as well!  I read that it was billions that actually was given into the Haiti Relief Fund of CLINTONS before all was tallied, it was stated at 10 Billion and only less than 800 million was actually put back into the relief!  Plus there is too many children that were moved off the island to give them a new life???  They were never heard of again!  Child trafficking??  The funds that were put into cell phones from a crony group and Crooked Hillary's brother was awarded the rights to mine Gold there?  If you fly over the island, half belongs to Dominican Republic and half to Haiti!  This tells the story!  The Dominican Republic is primarily Christian!  Haiti, in contrast have a lot of Witch Doctors, a lot of satan Worship and a potpourri of beliefs!  I flew over that island and was shocked at the contrast!  Haiti is pretty much barren an desolate from the air!  It looks desert like!  On the other side, the Dominican Republic is green lush and devoloped!"
zionist clintons whom work with marxist communist putin
Every country on this globe must imitate North Korea because of THIS MAN who calls himself a PRESIDENT. Every nation must begin developing a Nuclear Warhead capable of reaching anywhere on the planet for defence and deterrence against this man
"Donâ€™t get caught in the political correctness bull..We are so tired of all that  we just want Americans first, the wall and The wall...President Trump we are with you no matter how hard The infighting gets..."
"Ther has been trouble with Haiti before President Trump ever came to office. I kept reading of the trouble with their government years before, so stop putting all the wrongs on this president"
The Dems never cared for the Haitians! Just ask the Clinton foundation that took all the money that was â€œ supposedâ€ù to go to Haiti!!!
"It was a closed door meeting!!! Closed door meetings are private! That's called leaking! I don't believe it was that bad. Remember what Killery did to Haiti, that is extortion."
zionist clintons whose daughter got married in Israel. Zionist fund the Marxist Communist left agenda. Expose the Talmud and reinvestigated 911
"Well, I came here from Albania. Beautiful country, but a shithole nonetheless, as a matter of fact. Politically and economically."
Record the meetings for your own safety. These Dems will say anything and preach it as the truth to make you look bad. They are liars and manipulators. CYA Mr. President!! Keep up the great work for America.
Trump is a pathelogical liar
No need to record future meetings. Just keep the press out of them. And I say this as a person with a degree in journalism. This current crop are BUMS and cannot be trusted.
"I never said Haitians are Shitholes but obviously a very Shitholes Country. Calling them Shitholes was made up by Dems, I simply said Haiti is a Shitholes BUT Haitians are not Shitholes"
"The Clintons STOLE millions that were specifically directed to help that poor country!!  Truth hurts, Hillary!!!"
"zionist clintons whom also ""blew away America's health care funds as secretary of state"". Htichens"
Amazing you people are soooo ready to believe trump colluded with the Russians but not that the Clintons took Haitiâ€™s relief money.  Wow
"I'm sure Haitians would agree with you about their living conditions. Fed up with the piranhas in the press and in Congress. All they want to do is destroy, destroy, destroy. Now with efforts here and there to squelch the news and communications, something needs to happen to keep the right channels open. You spoke the truth, and usual they didn't like it. Too bad."
"Every meeting should be televised live, just like your meeting earlier this week. That way both the American public and the World get The untarnished truth."
"Yes sir, but you did refer to their nations as ""sh*tholes"" and that is an inexcusable breach of protocol and inappropriate for any head of state.Mr. President, I believe you are destined to be one of the greatest presidents in our nation's history,  You have accomplished amazing things so far and I fully support you, but you have to do better at reigning in your tongue.This is a self-inflicted wound that will make it impossible for any Democrat to compromise with you and provides cover for those RINO establishment slugs who oppose the wall.  It also feeds into the Democrat narrative of you and your supporters being racists.You can't afford these kinds of gaffs, if you are going to accomplish your agenda.God bless you, Mr. President.  Please try to refrain from these little unnecessary verbal gaffs."
"I am so tired of listening to the news coverage of this. I want everyone to get on with the work they were elected to do!  If they keep bringing negotiations to a screeching halt every time someone says a curse word, we are in trouble."
Absolutely!
Hey Hillary give Haiti its money back stop trying to attack the president to get the spot light off what ya did. This is more of her and her paid media leaking lies.
"What happened to the millions of dollars donated thru the ""Clinton foundation"" ( haha ) for the relief of the Haitian people after that devastating hurricane.  Why don't the lying, corrupt Democrats investigate that?"
"Mr. President, the next time there is bi-lateral talks in the Oval Office I highly suggest that no congrssional aides be present. They cannot be trusted. What you said was taken way out of context. Plus if I am not mistaken, this was an off the record meeting. So it shouldnt have been leaked. If the duly elected members of Congress cannot have talks in the Oval Office without their aides then they shouldnt be Congressman."
As an old retired cop I learned early in my career that you cannot trust what the media says. They will try to sensationalize a hangnail to boost viewership or increase sales.
"I am Daily so grateful for DJT I can hardly wrap my mind around it all.....   like David of the Psalms a flawed man but I have No Doubt he is a man after G-D'S Own HEART âù_ï¸è"
Pandering to your stupid base...unfortunately your comments have global consequences...you're a nation who has no place in the Oval office!
what global consequnces?
Sheehan Rahman 45 just pissed off a whole continent...Africa...which China is working to expand their influence...China is very happy to hear 45's deplorable comments!
I say Deport them all unless they have something to bring to this country and they have right ethics and we're talking about countries that have not even worry they don't have none of you people that need to back off on Donald and bring it on on me
"I have traveled extensively and have visited many countries that are â€œdevelopingâ€ù countries and in those travels I have learned that everyone sees these countries through their own lens of comfort, including Trump. Being a man, who has made his money catering with first class amenities, I can see him seeing these countries completely different than those where he can place golf courses and hotels. Especially, countries which are not only lacking in infrastructure, but whose problems are compounded by excessive violent crime. These places are not for everyone, but I found it sort of comical that apparently some of these countries responded by summoning the ambassadors to explain! For example, El Salvador. Itâ€™s a bit tough to go into a defensive mode when you have the second highest murder rate in the WORLD, rivaled only by Honduras. Here is the other interesting fact. The countries with the highest rates of violent crime, murder, are found in Latin American countries as well as African countries. This does not negate the fact that there are wonderful people all over the world, but countries have issues and these are facts. So, does the U. S.! Trump simply talks too much and is constantly giving opinions. I think that Trump would do well to get off Twitter and those countries would do equally well, not to get up on a high horse and behave in such an offended manner. Case and point: I recently heard that the government here got upset because the US is deporting their nationals for crimes committed, and they were jumping up and down about human rights! And get this, just a month or so ago they just â€œdissolvedâ€ù the opposing political party. â€œPoofâ€ù!  Gone! I saw a whirl of military activity and later read they were â€œrounding upâ€ù the opposition. Every country has got issues! Some worse than others."
"One must put Trump's comment in context. Haiti and most African countries have corrupt governments who treat their people terribly, especially women as opposed to a country like Norway that treats its citizens with respect and compassion. Unfortunately, people from these Third World countries, as a result of their governments, do not possess the skills that would benefit the U.S. as immigrants. Bottom line, Trump wants Merit Based immigration, that other advanced countries have invoked, that would provide those skills that would benefit the country now and in the future. That is the basis of his comment."
You should ask the dems what happened to all that money the Clinton foundation gave to Haiti more like stole should investigate that too
It is more of a S hole because of the money stolen from them through the Clinton foundation.  You have a rich area of the Island in Punta Cana that does nothing to help the rest of the country.
Even if he did say that it still would be true. Haitians are there own worst enemy. I've done humanitarian work there and yes they expect handouts and refuse to help themselves walk across the border to Dominican republic and its a tropical paradise.
"Democrats and the liberal media twist everything he says publicly so I have no doubt that they'd run at the chance to twist what he said in private to discredit our president and try to distract people from all the great things he's doing for our economy and country. 2nd and 3rd hand ""sources"" who weren't even there and have a vendetta against him are hardly credible or believable. I believe our president. Keep up the great work!"
Haiti IS a shithole! ANYONE with two eyeballs can SEE that. Just because someone holds back on actually SAYING it doesn't make it not the TRUTH. Being a PHONY in this world helps NO ONE. It's time to be HONEST about REALITY. Haitians ALLOWED their country to become a shithole. Don't kill the messenger.
"Travelled the world, not afraid of anyone or anything, but when it came time to go to Haiti I looked some stuff up, saw some photos and said, ""Welp, I ain't goin' there!"" Didn't see any pictures where someone wasn't holding a gun. They shoot each other in congress. Scariest place I could think of at the time."
Haiti is the way it because of Hillary. She did nothing for women there. Put they took the money were gave them and Hillary got it all for her foundation. Truth...
"Yep, ppl are just flocking to live in Haiti and Venesuela, Africa. WHAT is the big surprise here? He doesnâ€™t speek presidential? THATâ€™S WHY WE VOTED FOR HIM, bc heâ€™s a real Amerian, not a teleprompter puppet bot! _Ÿ˜Å Very fun watching the MSM meltdown. _Ÿ˜‚"
Anybody and everybody knows that except the lying media President Trump.I have no idea why they really believe people are gonna just eat their lies up as gospil.Their ego is showing.And its ugly too.Keep up the good work.We love you.God BLess
"Lol. I wouldn't be to hard on yourself even if you did make the remarks. People call them shithole countries all the time, because they are! Just something for the ""good-hearted"" Liberal to jump all over that's all."
"Don't trust the swamp. Backbiters, troublemakers. Regardless of what was said. Private meeting are just that. Dems have no morals.Make them pay for that one."
zionist swamp whom fund the marxist left
"Victoria A. Deobald Those are three terms that do not fit together for any rational understanding.So Trump could be seen as a Zionist. But a leftist can not be.Although the left can seen accused of being swamp and Marxist. They can not be Zionist. Name a Liberal that supports Israel. ""Zionist""- a supporter of Zionism; a person who believes in the development and protection of a Jewish nation in what is now Israel.Marxism calls ""Class Struggle"": where workers and their bosses fight against each other to gain for themselves. Marxists think that all of written human history has been divided by economic classes. ... They think that communism (or socialism) will be born from this struggle, just like capitalism was."
I'm sorry but it's a new year and if these folks keep going on like this stop working with them. Someone in that room leaks wording to their benefit it's time to call out individual!!!
"Here is a free history lesson - if you are White and live in the US, you are the product of immigration.  Your family came to this country to create a better life than what was available in their ""shithole"" country."

There just mad that there whole plan has fell apart right in front of there eyes and they continue to bash and make crap up..the democratic party is an absolute joke...Keep up the good work Mr. President we are all proud of you..
the Dems and never Trumpers can't win this one because if the Pres actually said these things and they aren't true then there is no reason for them to be here on a humanitarian temporary visa anymore and if they are true then whats wrong with the Pres stating a fact win win for the Pres
"How about this?  Would you support a law that banned fake news?  All of it?  Whether it's on the left or the right,  it would be banned from distributing anything less than facts and truth. Would you support that?"
"I will always support you, no matter what, but I do wish you would get a grip on your tongue, because when you speak, you represent the people who support you...And there are some of us that feel like vulgarity should be left to the party that practices same..."
"Since 'fake news' prevails on most news channels--no! Of course we don't believe our president made these derogatory statements! Carry on, Mr President--we're with YOU!"
Go look at Jeff Flakes Twitter. He's a republican.
Shithole...that's what everyone is freaking out about...I live in California and I can personally say it is becoming the shithole of the US....what a bunch of pansys...shithole really? I'm sure everyone's grandma said worse words than this....
"News reporting agencies are straight up garbage.... they should stay completely away from anything political... stick to local news, anything else they touch turns to hot garbage"
"Our President is correct in putting the well being of United States citizens first.  When we have little children sitting all bundled up in grade school classrooms  because the rooms are so cold, we need to take care of these problems before we take on the problems of many places around the world into which the global community has poured billions of dollars, large portion USA $'s, to rebuild, develop, etc., But for some strange reason, it appears that most of this money helps an elite few, while the general population still lives in squalor, and nearly starves.  I believe it was this deplorable situation to which the President recently referred, crudely for certain.  He was not labeling the people.  They need to go home, and demand their governments put common good before elite privilege.   We need to help as we can, but not by giving our own country away.  Praying for our President, and Vice President, and their families._Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡_ï¸è"
"We know they lie. Maybe until they stop playing politics and do their jobs for the American people,you should have open meetings with  media as you did with the immigration negotiation. Thus us Americans get to see firsthand, just who are working for us and who are Soros puppets. We know the 6 that came up with that crazy DACA deal are Soros puppets."
Look at the condition of many democrat strong holds. Not the prettiest and prospering districts. Illinois is a good example of how so many years of democrats at the helm can create a huge failed state. Send those shithole politicians to Haiti and El Salvador and let the Haitians stay.
"Well, their countries are shitholes _Ÿ˜_ stay home and fix your countries!! Dems have anything to say about Haiti? Tell them to ask the crook Clintonâ€™s about how they screwed them!!"
"Who cares really.  If their country was not a mess, of a barbaric nature, dare one say shithole, then why are they coming here?  Stay in your own country make it great again....._Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ_£"
Amen to that!
I believe we are getting close to a war. We are to devided I say just deport all illegals and do let anybody come into our country. And build the dam wall
You have to remember all the good news yesterday about Walmart upping wages and employees getting $1000 bonuses. They had to have something to differt everyone's attention.
"The phrase ""third world country"" that is beaten to death in the media is nothing more than a politically correct way of calling them a shithole country anyway."
The Russian collusion story didnâ€™t work SO now dems/libs grasping at anything to attack!! Every day for President Trump has been and will be a battle!!! Keep tweeting
"We know the media lies because simply put they never say anything good about President Trump... It's can't be all 100% negative, they won't report anything good."
zionist owned media like facebook pushing the communist left agenda
"I'm a big believer in cameras. It seems to help the innocent. Since body cams on police, we hear a lot less police brutality claims. Do they tone down the cops, probably. Do they discredit false claims, absolutely. Trump needs cameras everywhere....to protect himself"
The Dems came with an idiotic deal on the table that obviously didnâ€™t include the border wall by his tweets.  So an unknown butthurt source supposedly ran to WaPo and CNN reported the story less than 20 min after the meeting... maybe he does have a potty mouth so do I behind closed doors... if you canâ€™t stand up to your accusations itâ€™s a LIE!!
zionist owned media just like facebook
Mr president you must be a great president to deal with all the bull that comes your way you are amazing all I can say do the best you can do for us true American people we got your back speak your peace with the world we want to here what you have to say  God bless America please
"Who cares if you did.Sometimes I look at my house and say this place looks like a shithole.This should open your eyes.Trust none of them.Lindsey Graham and his best friend John MCcain are the ones who gave the FBI the fake dossier.You didn't side with them so this is what they do.Please don't make any deals with these snakes.All they want is DACA,illegals and refuges.No need to give in or rush.Maybe in 2018 republicans that really do back you will win."
No my house isn't a shithole.It just makes me nuts when it's messy.
The Democrats first and foremost mission is to take you down so never be alone and always always record your interactions when a Democrat is present. #MAGA _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸

"The doctor that was in the news couple weeks ago that supposedly committed suicide by sticking a knife in his heart, was a part of a group of doctors that went to Haiti to help the poor and sick. This was to be paid for by the funds from that Clinton Foundation. Short time into the mission the needed medications, saline solution all that is required to perform surgery ran out and no matter how much they requested supplies nothing arrived and ppl were dyeing. Eventually the doctors left and on the plane this doctor said he was going to blow the lid off that Clinton Foundation. Well he sure can't say a word now...."
They are shitholes. I think it's ironic how now the dems care about Haiti. Nobody said anything when the Clintons were down there running amuk.
We know the Democratic party is corrupt.. a bunch of lying and crying losers..maybe Trump should dig deeper and open thier wounds more.
"Peter, he did deny using the S-hole remark, only one dem senator has ""confirmed"" he said it, two other senators, who are GOP said they never heard him say it. This is such absolute nonsense and typical of the left who want to distract from the real issues."
"As far as I am concerned the President can say what he wants...I have said things I later was not happy about...but what the heck, get off your holier than though horse and see the reality of human nature...nobody is perfect. Diane Feinstein lost her Feinstein Noblesse Oblige when she had a ""cold"". Maybe our President had a ""cold."" Get over it."
"We want people to come to our country, first legally and then to make our country better not be a negative impact where the American people are paying their way.  We can not support the world, but the Dems think we can.  Lets' take their millions or billions and do it then.  LOL"
We are tired of immigrants living free and we have homelessness a couple of blocks away from White House. What did Obama do? Nothing! Homelessness is going up in our state also.
"Hussein Obama=Arabic, Sunni Muslim from Saudi Arabia not from Iran. Reinvestigate 911 now way Iran was behind it. zIONISTS kept Obama in power"
I WONDER IF the dems will ever address the 13 BILLION the clinton cartel PROMISED Haiti after their devastating earth quake that has YET to be sent!
"President Trump, we know what you meant! We also know liberals try to distort every word that comes from your mouth...I stand with you! #MAGA #wethepeople #getoverit"
"If the left worked one tenth as hard at trying to support this country and its citizens as they do at attacking the President for everything he does, everything he says, and whatever he or his family look like, maybe they'd be a contribution to society.  As it is, they're just like having a house full of cobras--no use whatsoever, and dangerous as hell."
"You continue to be an embarrassment to our country! Your true character shows every time you speak!!!  Colleagues refuse to lie for you any more!!!  Time for you to resign!"
"Hey! If the shoe fits! You just say what many of us say at home in our dens. Why donâ€™t the leaders of these countries lead?! Their people would want to stay home if they had a country that had leaders that cared about the people.Hey! Letâ€™s not forget the great hospital that Hilary was supposed to build in Haiti... her and the corruption of the leaders pocketed or waisted this money!"
"By now, I would hope the people of our nation have caught on to the very evident fact that the Democrat Party will lie and twist the truth to try and get their way. Don't back down we need the wall and we need to do away with chain immigration along with the reckless lottery."
record the meetings.  even if you pretend...that might end dirty leaks.  Nancy Pelosi and pocahontas think giving tax cuts to big corporations that are handing it out to the working class people is an insult lol.  translate...tax them higher and give it to the GOVT and not the people...its crumbs...hey we take crumbs.  keep going mr President.

"You had people from cogress there who heard you and are saying you did say these awful, biggoted, vile, statements.  You are lying to the people ahain including your base, who are lrobably a part of some of these groups.  Enough is enough.  You have brought down the presidency of the United States to a new level.  You are supposed to set the bar."
"But, Mr. Prez...  They are a shithole country. Still looks like an earthquake hit yesterday. AFTER receiving billons in aid!!"
"If he did call it a shithole it's because it is lol I mean I live in NJ and it's a shithole too, but I rather live in this shithole than in a 3rd world country shithole."
"My best friend was raped by a man from Haiti....the Police would not arrest him, even after she went to the ER and had a Rape Kit done.....this man needs to be Prison!"
Youâ€™ve lied hundreds of times already â€œstable geniusâ€ù this is merely another feather in your cap until you get taken down by Mueller.
It wonâ€™t happen... lol
"Lisa Henriksen Foote it will, Presidents have been impeached for much less."
"David Smith so which ones are you talking about? Considering only two have been impeached, Clinton in 1998 and Johnson in 1868, that blows your crap out of the water. Neither were convicted and removed from office. Johnson's 'offence' was removing someone from his Cabinet without Senate approval and Clinton blatantly lied to a Grand Jury."
David Smith who runs the house and senate?
Wonâ€™t happen. Wake up.
David Smith really...
Bet he has a better relationship with the Haitians than the Clintons do.  Where is all that money that the Clinton Foundation had collected for the relief effort in Haiti?  Hmmm?
"The only thing you did wrong Mr. President, is tell the truth. There countries leaders are the ones responsible for the condition of there own countries."
"Better Solution would be instead of bring people in from these distressed countries, cut a deal with these countries to improve and rebuild these countries but money and aid is distributed under the control of US or a By a Cabinet Secretary....Everytime we give these countries Money it never goes to reconstruction it gets gobbled up /stolen by the President and leaders of these countries to their own bank accounts and their swiss bank accounts..."
Well said Louie!!
"Try to speak less, and trim your words, in order not to spring controversy all the times.If your words bring controversy all the times, then there is something wrong with the way you talk..Mr. president, pls. Moderate your speeches.."
We people in this country are not politically correct...the majority of the people here are far worst than he is
And what would Haitians do about it anyway will the Criminal Clintonâ€™s send out a hit squad my God they exploited the Haitians out of billions of dollars after the earthquake which by the way should be investigated and the business center that the Clintonâ€™s started but never finished what crime did they commit there Criminal Killery Clinton is the most corrupt individual in the history of our nation and something must be done about her
Begging the investigation where the billions went after the world contributed to Clinton and Bush collection of rebuilding Haiti fund!?!?
"Hillary Hernandez, Whats worse calling a Country  a ""shitwhole""  or Hillary calling Americans ""Deplorables""? Oh I forgot, Hillary was the savior of all the democrats!!!! Have you forgotten what Obama and Hillary done to our Country!!! Be ready ""Trump"" Will win the ""2020"" Election!!!!"
"The poor people who live in these horrible countries are victims of corrupt, authoritarian, socialist politicians who have made these places hell on earth for their people while they, the ruling class live in opulence. S&*thole"" is an accurate description of these countries."
Now Trump is denying that he used a derogatory word. So who's telling the truth? The Democrats had an opportunity to make a deal with DACA. But they did not meet any of Trump's minimum guidelines. Now they're being vindictive. What else is new?
"_Ÿ‘ç_Ÿ‘ç_Ÿ‘çBrilliant -â€œno trust!â€ù.  It is plain betrayal and spreading hate; even the blind can see and no longer can trust the â€œgossipâ€ù  media.    It is â€œfamily feudâ€ù.  It will take forever to repair the Trustsâ€™ Wall.  All future meetings with no trusts must be â€œrecorded for quality controlâ€ù purposes.  Many things are best left unsaid."
"It's like this the truth hurts. By pretending something isn't true doesn't make it so. People want to close their eyes to the truth and pretend it isn't so. Can't fix a problem if you don't admit there is one. Other countries say whatever they want about us and we are suppose to just take it. Thank you Mr. President for the truth. The rest of you that wanna cry and whine, open your eyes."
"bush and clinton collected 2 BILLION $ for haiti, unfortunately, it went into the toilet called the clinton foundation"
"Liberals are perfectly fine with what the Clinton's ""actually did"" to the Haitian people for their own monetary gain. Leaving them with what President Trump accurately described as a mess. << There, feel better now? I knew you would."
Can we plz focus on the Uranium 1 crimes and get these traitor criminals prosecuted? This is all distractions used to keep the public ignorant. We all know who was involved in this crime. They thought they would get away with it. Prosecute them!!!!
The triggered liberals and media will seize anything to make you look like a monster. Your description of those 3rd world hellholes was completely accurate-it is simply an inconvenient truth that some rat in your White House circle ran to the media with. Find out who that was and fire them. End of one problem so you can deal with the real ones.
"Well, other than calling it a â€œshitholeâ€ù and that you didnâ€™t want people from â€œshithole countriesâ€ù coming here...but other than that, nothing derogatory."
Nothing to apologize for. Your transparent and honest. You say it like it is. You also keep your promises and actually do what the American Working Class elected you to do. MAGA
"Your only trying to do the job they neglect!  Trump's first thought how he can save the Taxpayers dollars that's why the statement was made!  Everyone knows Democrats import any and everybody for a Democrat vote!  Trump is thinking way ahead briing immigrants in that contribute  and raise higher standards not cost the country And bring the standards down!  No ur jails are full but that's okay Democrats give felons rewards at the election poll for their votes!  Trump wants America to be #1 not #10 where the Democrats put America!  Education, job, standards  have been lowered to accommodate !"
"Sadly Gang, a ""S-H"" of a country ""it is what it is"".  As a matter of fact, Haiti,  like many other 3rd-World S-Hs, seems to have always been due to the poor caliber and greed of its so-called ""Chosen-Leaders"".  It's always the ""Leaders"" fault where ""absolute power"" does indeed, corrupt, absolutely.  Just burn millions of dollars on the lawn of The White House, every , say, Every Saturday Night, this Summer.  We will, at last, see what becomes of the ear-marked riches we have and will bestow upon the 3rd. World ""S-Hs"".  Thank you sir,  I am very pleased that I voted for you and you won.  Bravo sir!  Keep on keeping on."
Get rid of the leakers it was a closed meeting you know who shared it.... maybe they are sharing other things from other so called meetings just my opinion but drain the swamp it's still full of trouble
"Fake News:CNN headline:Trump slams Haitians,says,""get them out""!Actuality:Trump asks in plain language in a private meeting ,Why are we flooding our nation with the third world? Question needed to be asked.Answer unfortunately known,but not said out loud...."
One of the worst problem with Haiti Is  devastating hurricanes wiping out their shacks. They need stronger shelters and infastructure.
"I'm so tired of this ""fake news"" crap! Yes Mr President, I think you should record all of your meetings, as well as have a EAA take Dictation of the minutes, =AND= have Sarah always in your meetings ====> she totally has your best interest at heart! <3"
So democrats think every country is great then we can send all the illegal immigrants back to their wonderful countries
"We don't need or want a weak, pathetic, anemic traitorous president.  We've already had 20+ years of that.  We don't, or won't, hold it against you for speaking the truth.  Just remember the same liberals who have a problem with ""this"" statement were more than OK with having grown men pee in the same bathrooms as our wives and daughters."
Wonder why it is always a un-named source that tells these lies . With all these stories the Dims keep coming up with it looks like at least one person would come forward to speak face to face if they are telling the truth ..
And YES...record your meetings...now they are on a witch hunt to prove you are mentally unstable. Those meeting should have been recorded all along...YOU cannot trust anyone. Their livelihoods are at stake...they almost had their socialism...now it is slipping out of their hands.
"It amazes me how the President talks about the wonderful relationships he has with ""groups"" of people ..... When your looking down on a crowd from 10 stories up what may seem like a group in support may actually be a group in protest. It's when you actually come down to ground level you know the truth. Something this guy will never understand _Ÿ_”_Ÿ_”_Ÿ_”"
"How soon people forget about the destruction the Clinton's caused.Beghazi....money theft...treason, etc.  The Media, conveniently, forgets about. Payoff!!!Taking Haiti's money and skimming money from their foundation, should have brought legal charges against them. Why are they exempt from the law????   Payoff!!!!"
"I agree.  Record everything.  I think your comments grew on CNN when a reporter said those countries were ""probably"" African countries and Haiti."
"I don't understand why you have to say all the ignorant things! I voted for you, my kid has 23+ in the USAF, we supported you. Just get off of social media, all of it, run this country like we know you can. Sorry, I'm a senoir and can't make it from check to check w/o help from my kid!! Fix it!!!"
"He has done more for the good of this country then any other president has done before him in this short of time. If you listen just to him and not the media he isnâ€™t saying ignorant things. Im also a senior. You have to be realistic. He is not going to fix it where your son doesnâ€™t have to help you financially, but your son will get a raise so it makes it easier on him to help you. Please keep supporting our president. he needs all of us."
"I'm not jumping ship on Trump, he says stupid stuff daily and then he has the media adding to it and twisting words. Realistic is I worked all my life and made good money and saved, all I was taught to do, 2 hospital stays later with surgery and no insurane, bye bye savings! I should NOT have to rely on anyone. My opinion.Why would he not do everthing he can for Seniors?"
No. He is the first president in History we know exactly what he is thinking. He is giving all people access.
The media can no longer be trusted.  There are a few who are competent and can report the facts.  The bias ones are only competent with fake news.  I trust National Enquire more than these fake rags.
It is not You; it's them!  Anyone that has an ounce of sense knows the haters are paranoid and psychotic--Paranoid is delusions of grandeur and thinking things are happening that aren't!  Psychotic is the inability to tell the difference between reality and fantasy or fiction or make-believe!!!!
"Yep, the media reported that you ""suggested ""......  so I suggested that they don't have anything valuable to report because it is so opinionated and made up.  So  the heart strings keep being pulled with lies.  By the way, you stole my favorite word..... I'm good with that.... thanks for working on getting our economy out of the ""Shithole"""
"Doesn't matter Sir. As realists, let us not pretend that these corrupt, phony politicians don't speak like this. They just don't have  opposition, reisitance, self righteous crybabies running to the press and repeating it! I know Barak used language like this and the selective outrage is astounding!"
I don't know anyone who is running to vacation in Haiti or Africa so President  Trump is probably right....
"Having worked with someone who spent a year there doing missionary work and seeing the corruption and poverty, shithole was exactly his assessment of the place.  Not because of the people, but because of the conditions they lived in and the graft of those who proportedly work in their interests."

"Perhaps we should stop all immigration from all countries for five years - since apparently our government officials want to keep everyone that is here - here - then in return for these people staying - no immigrants or work visas for five full years - no more anchor babies - no more chain migration - no more lottery visas and English will be the official language.   This would give us time to figure out what we have going on here,"
Yes make your own filmings of all your meetings. There was this person that did that and it proved great help when he was in court. The British journalist cut and doctored the interview he got of this man and in court both versions were played. Do it Mr. Trump.
Mr. President I think you should give direct order to a platoon of military men and women to go to the play offs and to super bowl to stand right in front and facing the players until the first note is played make about face and face the flag. Call police unions and have their officers do the same. Then setup DUI check point at every exit. Of course announce it before the games. Hit them where money is
I'm so sick of people talking bad about you Mr president TRUMP.  Best president that we have had in yrs.  YOUR DOING AN AWESOME JOB!  Please include dental in health plans ty
"Get it through your head. Leaks happen. Your personal style of building relationships can work, but language matters. Having people there to be your witness is important.I'm from Queens, all my life, I get it, we talk a certain way that can be misconstrued.But merit is based on the individual, not the nation of origin. Bring in the best any nation has to offer.This was an unfortunate distraction.Merit immigration, a sane worker visa program are more important than any static defense along the border.No deal on anything till we have a merit based immigration program like the rest of the world."
"I have the problem with men sometimes generally, they work with me, and do not calculate in that someone has to clean the working place, even in the management they don't, nor drinking pauses, etc!

"Pres Trump, we loyal followers of you know what you are going through with all the desperate Dems who would lie, gossip and go against you.  Don't even look back at their accusations.  We know you are true and good."
"Liberals don't care what he says or does because they only hear what they want. Watched his rallys and then mainstream would take parts of sentence and run with narrative they wanted. It is why i shut off cable, nothing but sheeple still watching that bs"
Mr. President please don't make the same mistakes I make on a daily basis. Which you seem to do. Choose your words a little more wisely. Because even the media we listen to spin your comments in a negative light even those that like what you're doing. And let's go back to the immigration policies we had between 1927 and 1964.
"well Hillary Clintons brother got him a gold mine out of that country ,,, and she got to play queen for a day with all that relief money  ,but from what I hear not one school one hospital are houses got built ,"
The Clintons collected all that money and left them living in tents...
and it was billions
Why aren't they being prosecuted?
think we all would like to know that
"You don't have to explain yourself. This is just the liberals doing what they do; foaming at the mouth with arched backs and hair spiked across their spine,claws gripping the ground beneath them, hissing like the histrionic hyenas in heat that they are. Carry on, sir! YOu're doing  great job!"
Nothing is private for President Trump because the shitholes will leak everything including how he wipes his butt. This is very sad and disturbing for America. We have a non politically correct President who speaks volumes in laymans terms and the pussified criminal politicians cant deal with the fact that their political crime game (gravytrain) is being diminished.
I don't imagine Haiti would be such a s******* had Hillary Clinton use the money to rebuild it instead of stealing
"Your people trust you, Mr. PRESIDENT. The Lord showed me that you are a type of Daniel. God protected him in the lions den. You have ""lions all around you, waiting to devour you, but God will shut the mouths  of those lions and you will  come out of anything they try against you. Keep God in your life and in the country. We love you and your family!"
Hell...... It was Hiliary & Slick Willy that stole all the Millions that were to rebuild Haiti after the hurricane!   What about the Dems caring about that???
I think we need to maintain our international relations with other countries instead of casting them away when they need our help!
then you go pay for them
"We need a President who tells the truth, not someone who sugar coates things. Trump is right, those countries are shitholes."

How he described Haiti isn't even news. I love that he says what he thinks. He's got the guts to say out loud what most are too chicken to say.

"As for the foreign dignitaries condemning Trump's comments, we're talking the UN, former Haitian President, El Salvador, Somalia-- to name a few who have done well by creating these s***holes."

"Should record ALL meetings for full transparency. But withhold any security sensitive material. That would DESTROY the Democratic party in short order and ""We The People"" would always have the truth to hold both parties in check. No more lies from ANYONE."
you have a better relationship than the clintons.  haiti will hang them if they ever show up in Haiti again having robbing them blind.
What did Clinton and Bush do with all that money raised for Hati exactly nothing  like most Countries it never goes for their people  It is about their vote  and who is paying for Dem.'s and some Rep. Mess we Taxs payers  Time for Politicans to be held liable for their Lies We Amercans dont trust them thats why not of them are President
"Mr. President, youâ€™re doing a wonderful job. If you did disparage these countries, though, please remember that people of merit can still come from these ravaged countries. If their merit is equal to people from other countries, it makes sense to give those folks preferential treatment so that they can get out of their bad situations. Please do record future meetings, but also choose to meet with those who more closely represent the ideals of the people who voted you in, not a bunch of Dems and RINOâ€™s!"
Yes he's doing a wonderful job putting our service men and women stationed in Africa at risk!

"Trump supposedly calls Haiti a sh*thole bc it is..You know why it is? Ask A Haitian. It's bc the Clinton Foundation embezzled all the money that was meant for them to rebuild after the earthquakes...but if that wasn't enough, they then stole all of the mining rights to the natural resources in Haiti, including their gold."
"yup-and then the Dr. who called out the Clintons on theri corruption of funds that were to go to Haiti, is mysteryisly found dead. hmmmmmm"
How about the reporter found dead in Haiti after she released what the Clintons did with the Haiti money for the repairs needed there. They stole all their money.
Hard to keep spreading doom and gloom when Americans are working and we are bringing businesses back to America! Stock Market at it's highest mark ever. Companies raising their pay scale and giving bonuses to their employees. For those who love doom and gloom don't worry the Democrats and media are working hard to bring it to you.
"Some very reasonable folks disagree,, Why do you not just explain your statements rather than lie about them. Perhaps there's a very reasonable explanation. We support your policies, embrace them, but you seem to get in the way of your own progress by statements made every other day. You need a filter in the White House. Those most respected are not rising to the task."
haiti is a s hole. been there and to the other side of the island also a st hole. we do need some quality control on immigration.
"I'm reminded of in  Nehemiah whereby they ""did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other,"" Neh. 4:17  You Mr President, are doing a marvelous work in rebuilding America again, but having to fight off the opposition with your other hand the whole way.  Keep on keeping on, as you are making extraordinary progress. Amen."

"At first I hated you but now all I feel is a deep sense of pity for someone who is unable to love and care for others wholeheartedlyâ€_I feel sorry for you knowing that you were not a wanted child by your father due to your handicap, children born mentally disable suffer enough but more so when their own parents want nothing to do with them, to know that you were not nurtured, held, cuddledâ€_.that even though your parents tried to pass you as â€œnormalâ€ù your learning disabilities became obvious during your school years while being sent away to boarding schools far from your parents so that they could pretend you did not exist only to be bullied by peers for lacking the ability to learn at the same speed and level as everybody else.

Did Paula White tell you that what is in your heart comes out if your mouth?  God made us to have a direct correlation between our heart and mouth. Please dont get so familiar with those around you that you say things you should not."
"It seems we have a never ending case of he said, she said between the media and DJT. Kind of over it all and I plan the talk to President HRC about the mix ups. *edit for the slow ones, there is NO President HRC but the media said there would be. Hence, the humor in it all."
"We have to learn to take care of our own; legal citizens, veterans, poor not hand out shite to everyone who's passing through or taking advantage.  I agree with the meaning.  What part of illegal immigrants is hard to comprehend - if I were doing something illegal I'd have consequences to deal with these people don't and feel entitled to what many Americans work hard for"
"Also, you don't have a good relationship with Hatians, you ended their sanctuary program.  They *definitely* hate you.And the country you want more people from is the socialist utopia of Norway?  You're a Republican (for now), remember?Or are you acknowledging that liberal policies create better countries than conservative ones?What is your point?  What is the point of anything you do?"
"""The first thing that we want you to understand is that spirit has no color or race to it. It doesn't matter whether your skin is white, black, red, brown - whatever. No one out there is any better than you, and you are no better than anyone else out there.""-- John Peters (Slow Turtle), WAMPANOAG"
Please take that to heart and do it.
"Positive and life changing outreach of America and the global community to countries that are desperately poor, uneducated, and corrupt will NOT be accomplished with lottery type of immigration or immigration at all.  Admitting a handful of of folks from countries in need to the USA is nothing more than a ""feel good"" political moment that is meaningless; a very fake and self serving. moment.  We should welcome the best and the brightest who are willing to work hard to immigrate into the USA and bring benefit to the American dream AND who will help to develop a real working system of private (not gov't) charitable out reach to those suffering countries in need.  That will bring real change, wide-scale, self-replicating, and long lasting.  Wake up people and stop being played by the feel good politics that always fail to accomplish the goals.  Think big, think outside of the box, set lofty goals and then soar past them."
"Mr President.  Tape any dealings you have with these snakes. Durbin is one of the worst.  Tell them at the beginning of the meeting that since there are so many false news leaks you will be recording the meeting, and that it will be disposed of in a couple of months.  Leaks might dry up."
"I just wish the Left and the media could get this â€œup in armsâ€ù about our dying Veterans, opioid crisis, unsustainable debt load, Constitutional rights, and the general well- being of AMERICANS. The people know this is just another attempt at distraction..."
I am so sorry that you are treated so badly when you are trying so hard to make our country great again. I have lost a lot of people in my life that I thought were my friends because I support you but I will continue to support you because you are the greatest thing that has ever happened to this country. Love you!!!!! <3
"Mr President, keep up the good work! You know the dems just want voters! They don't care how it affects the  country! They know people from these loser countries will vote for them!! The only reason the  dems win anything is by cheating! They get very creative about voter fraud!"
Unless you've been to a third world country keep your opinions to yourself. I've been to a third world country and they are shitholes. I'm sure that makes a millennial or a lily-livered liberal all queasy but the truth of the matter is Trump's right on most of the things he says and do does get over yourself
"Record, record, record.  Once the lies come out - and you know they will - tweet a recording is available of that part of the meeting is available to the public.  You won't need to defend yourself against lies when there's recorded proof of what was actually said."
"You left out part , You didn't steal millions from the relief money that was supposed to help them after the disaster . Wonder who did ? .... lets ask the Clinton News Network ."
"Not a problem. The Dems are making reservations for their vacations in Haiti. Sounds like they're putting their money where their mouths are. Oh....wait, what?"
I think those who want to bear false witness and cause drama will Always be of that persuasion. This kind of behavior from grown men and women who are suppose to be of good education and good integrity is unacceptable and every time they latch on and start building  a measure of momentum just exposes them more for what they are.
"Sir, if those were your words, you are absolutely correct. Please spare a thought for the handful of white South Africans being systematically murdered by a terrorist ANC-government orchestrated genocide. Thank you!"
That meeting was not televised or recorded - its Durbins [2nd leading Democrat]  word against Trumps.  More liberal havoc. to take down Trump.  Why would any political figure spread that story to the media if he didn't have a sinister reason.
"I support you, sir.  WeAll know what these countries are , and the dems and media have no understanding about what we in America feel."
"Diane Feinstein and Senators who can not respect the privacy of closed door meetings should not be invited to those meetings. I suggest selecting an entirely new group of bipartisan Senators to discuss immigration. Diane Feinstein should also be barred from joining her committee for closed door meetings. She is a security risk. Then there is the issue of the fake news constant reporting of gossip as fact ... but that, though serious and destructive, is a lesser problem.#MAGA"
Dems are just upset because they were never able to get their hashtags to actually help these countries. Instead they raped the relief funds that were supposed to help rebuild housing and instead gave them a lobbyist cell phone provider instead.
The socialist/ communist media in the USA spews propaganda 24/7!  And remember how the Clintons stole from the Haitians!
You have that right!
"what is concerned, where is Haiti, when is the calamity destructed the area that hit them, how is trust to gain in storm destroying everything? what is to relate with Haiti and to have hand over HELP by the presidents? what is with ""no trust""?"
We keep Haiti poor so Us and the French can move drugs through the country easily same thing with Cuba are you guys morons?
"Dirtbag Durbin. Revealing ANY information from a private meeting should be dismissal! Whatever was said or not, you are always looking out for Americaâ€™s best interest. You are appreciatedâ™¥ï¸è_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ’™"
"There's a reason why Cruise Lines and hotel chains don't travel or build in certain areas of the world.....Let's cut the crap, some places are shitholes and we've all used the word, so get off your high and mighty attitude box!"
You've gotten to the point now where even if you were telling the truth the only ones who'd believe it are your base supporters -- thankfully a small and dwindling number of people.  I can't remember ever hating a person with as much intensity - it's invigorating some days.
100% agree. I sleep badly knowing he speaks for us  _ thankfully I only Have 86 days to retirement.
"We all know the media and the liberals will say and do anything  and everything to try to hide and cover up the scandal that is being more exposed everyday of what the Obama administration has done to the American people....And yes, they want as many people to get over here, legal or not to vote for them.."
"Well, I am African, I was born and grew up here, I am still living here. One thing I can tell you: The day you decide to visit some African countries, you will not only agree with Mr. President Donald Trump but also you will say that may be Mr. Trump should increase more something instead of just saying that ""they are shitholes"".  Believe me, here we got no dreams of a better future!!!"
"Hillary stole all the relief money that was meant to rebuild their country, it's all in her and Bill's fake charity organization ! ! !  otherwise it wouldn't be such a shithole country !"
"Dems have a demonstrated history of lying! Ie obama, Hillary, reed, pelousey, Durbin etc!I never believe them!Mike sr"
If only you could stop telling the truth and just say what people want to hear. If only you could just read from a teleprompter the words someone else wrote. If only you could just sound like all the other lying politicians. If only you could say what people want to hear and then accomplish nothing for your entire term. ~sarcasm~
"The country is a shithole!  Shouldnâ€™t be after the billions in aid that the Clintons stole.  They need to have a supervised election that the Clintons canâ€™t corrupt and then seize all Clinton assets and use their resources to finally rebuild.  Beautiful people but as long as the Clinton machine controls the country, they are doomed."
"Regret but the governments of those countries are corrupt and do nothing for their people . Regret   The negative attention this has brought to their circumstances but they need to be held accountable for their own . They have their people leave their loved ones to come on a work visa to USA ,  for 6 months they work 14 hour days , rent a room to save money to take back to their families . The cycle needs to end , this is not the best quality of life  to build strong families ."
Look at what the Clintons and other liberals did to Haiti. They stole billions of relief donations from Haiti. Billions!
"Then why are people who were in that meeting coming forward to say you did say vile racists things..Oh right, it's the Democrats..your excuse for everything. Of course you never lie, right ?"
Haiti would have been a better country if the Clintons didnâ€™t steal the $$ from the relief dollars sent to them.
The Democrats need to move to those countries then we wonâ€™t have to worry about what is said... and please take Hilary to Haiti after what the Clinton foundation did to them..
"Svp, faites emprisonner Hilary."
"the point of the questions were valid, even if language was undiplomatic.  You should be able to trust those in a closed meeting to act with discretion. Sorry that everything has to be politicized.  Were the actual concerns ever addressed?"
"I NEVER believed in Fake News and Fake Media, Mr. President. Keep up doing a good work and continue to make us all proud! Donald J. Trump"
"Haha omg. Funniest thing how much he lies. If he didnâ€™t say it, his members would have denied it from the start. No one there, no republicans, no whitehouse staff has come out to deny this report. And it has taking him a full day to come up with lie. Again."
"clintons could have made a difference in Haiti, countries need to make more of an effort to take care of their own, pride in their country!!!"
"Just Continue inviting the Media Pukes to your normally closed to them meetings...No way they can Falsify or Embellish whatâ€™s said, like the Immigration meeting! One less chance of CNN or PMSNBC sticking a knife in your back _Ÿ˜__Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸"
"Some of your best friends are Haitian, I'm sure. If lies were weights you had to pick up every time you blustered your way through one,  you'd have sunk below earth's crust long ago. Maybe to China. Where they wouldn't welcome you either."
"They will twist everything you say because they are on a witch hunt. Recording meetings may not be a bad idea. But the liberals and Dems will believe the lies no matter the proof.  You are a good president and a decent man. I'm glad you have the strength to stave off their insidious accusations."
"I do believe it would be prudent on Trump's part to do just that...record EVERYTHING, for PROOF.  That way there is no doubt as to what he said, and the media can't twist anything with facts at hand. (well, they shouldn't be)"
"Would make Muller,s job easier."
"I couldn't blame him if he did blow his stack and say it. All of the Democrats and some of the Republicans work against him. He tries his best to work with them but they are unwilling to work with him. They are like we want this, give it to us, and then no, no, no we're not giving you that. Just like the DACA thing, they want the  deal but they won't compromise and give him the wall. Then when they don't get what they want, they run right out and file a lawsuit against him, and the corrupt judges go along with them. I think he manages his temper pretty good. If it were me, I would be constantly be blowing my stack."
"Left wing idiots following orders from left sick evil elite idiots will look for, make up, and twist or manipulate anything you say or do. YIU KUST RECORD ALL TO COVER YOUR BUTT ...trust no one! Pray!"
"Everything the president accomplishes, or says, is attacked by the democrats who offer nothing but lies and distortions.  Why that isn't treason is beyond me."
"Haiti, the country founded on government sanctioned mass murder and rape of people from a racial minority. What a classy place _Ÿ§ê"
I believe he said it. I believe it was a moment he didn't expect to become public. I prefer that he is accountable and offers a heart felt apology. I support him but am disappointed that he unravelsl the momentum he gained these past few weeks. Impulsive. I'm still here..
Why?? He was only telling the truth! Do some research. We give $Billions to Puerto Rico and Haiti and their leaders are so corrupt they take the money for themselves and there is no repercussions. With Trump they won't be allowed to get away with it. http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/01/puerto-rican-ceo-sends-engineers-to-help-fema-efforts-calls-local-pols-inept.html
"Every phone call, every meeting would be recorded and under my lock and key. It would come out when needed to prove their lying. The first drain the swamp should have been finding ever single czar and Obama buddy there and show them to the door the day you entered it."
"Having been to Africa a dozen times, I can confirm that most of those countries are fully dysfunctional. You are absolutely right. No one would ever consider immigrating to Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Congo, Eritrea, etc since they are so screwed up. Little works properly."
"They are _Ÿ’© countries because their leaders are _Ÿ’© leaders!...and thatâ€™s why everyone wants to come here!...and thatâ€™s the _Ÿ’©E  truth!!! _Ÿ˜__Ÿ’•"
"Thank you for not coming to the UK, it's amazing that you finally realised that you are not wanted here. Also congratulations on successfully lying to the American people about the reasons for not coming."
Kevo Mbewa well?
Whoâ€™d want to come to your crappy Socialist country anyway? Itâ€™s still amazing to me that yâ€™all forget that America has saved your butts more than once. You donâ€™t live here; you donâ€™t deserve to express your opinion.
But you donâ€™t live here so why are you expressing your opinion..?
"""Crappy socialist country"" lol really can't wait to use my 6 weeks paid holiday this year_Ÿ_£_Ÿ_£ also I'm feeling a bit peaky, instead if taking a bank loan out or dying a slow death, I think I'll use some of this healthcare that we have on tap. Enjoy the next high school massacre lol"
"Mr. President, people from Haiti are not putting  drugs inside here. Sorry but I believe you said that about  the poor country.  Democrats never will be your friends, remember that."
"What is the big deal???  If, IF he,said it, it's because it's true.  These countries have been crap holes since the beginning.  I don't believe democrats to begin with!"
"And if you did, I donâ€™t care. Most of the countries in the world ARE shitholes.Especially African countries. And that does include Haiti.#MAGA"
"The Clintons need to be in jail for what they did to Haiti, these people have not been given any help to get a leg up...it is very sad."
I am wonder also owhat happened to thee millions and millionsof dollars that was raised for Haiti   It doesn't seem like it has been used there
Need to investigate what happened to all the donaated money clinton to to Haiti and check out who own the mineral rights to most of Haiti.
The Traitor that ran to the Washington Post with a comment he may have misunderstood in a PRIVATE meeting should be banned from all private meeings with the President.  Disgraceful behavior and very untrustworthy Senator.
"I support you 100 %. That will not change!! But. trust only,  your family. Now this story is all we will hear this weekend. They will twist and analyze every word you say. I'm blunt also and say things I regret. Let's both , be careful ."
Donâ€™t apologize...they are shitholes and we are tired of being overrun by people who hate us yet come here in droves and tax our system.   Time to close immigration for ALL nations until we sort this mess out.
"Keep them accountable for their lies President Trump.  The truth always comes out in the end and what the World needs now is, love and truth!  Thanks for being the solution to the world.  You are adored!"
All of those countries are in bad shape because of the Leaders in those countries pocket the money instead of repairing the people homes and their infrastructure. The rich trying get more powerful and richer instead of building or repairing their countries even here
"Iâ€™m fine with your comments,.. my ears arenâ€™t made of glass and they wonâ€™t break.  Sometimes you have to call it as you see it,.. and if it hurts, maybe you should do something about it"
"You are doing a great job!  Please don't let the fake news and twisted media derail your efforts.  And, I absolutely LOVE your sense of humor.  Don't change who you are or what you are doing!!!!  This is why I voted for you!"
"Look up all the trash talk Johnson did while in office!  It will make Trump's language sound like kindergarten talk!  But hey,  he was a democrat!"
You stated the obvious reason why many Haitians (and Salvadorans and Nigerians) flee their country. Keep speaking the truth Mr. President!
"Sir you are trolled by a nest of nasty bees. You say something, they suck it up then on the way to the hive it gets distorted and digested. Then when they unload their gatherings it is not honey but fake news. Record what you can."
I feel sorry for racists who doesnt know that any country can be poor and desperate and the way its going America is close to be roaming around the world looking for food and accomodation. This world is not yours..
"Yes, Mr. President, please record all of your meetings as is done at your rallys. Then when the dems tell us 'no one showed up' there is proof of their lies."
So who you going to believe folks the Democrats who say Donald said something derogatory or Donald who has been up front all along. The Democrats have proved to be the worst Liars on the face of the Earth with the exception of the devil
You donâ€™t think he lies??
"To a degree everyone lies but Donald Trump normally does not lie the Democrats however normally do lie.. and in this case, I believe Donald because he's a Christian man of morals where the Democrats don't believe in Christ or God. And don't think they have a day when they will stand in front of them both. But they will stand in front of God"
"Unfortunately we live in a society were people get butt hurt on assumptions before they get the facts.No one is allowed to slip and say something by mistake. Things are always taken out of context in politics."
"Itâ€™s ok Donald, just sit back and let them keep making fools of themselves, it must be really hard being a democrat right now with all the winning going on, and all their lies are being debunked."
"It's ok Prez, we all now know just how corrupt the left media really is, if their lips are moving they are lying. Bottom line is....the election is over, we won the darn thing; and if I remember correctly that's exactly what Muzziebama told McCain in a Bill roundtable a few years ago. Keep kicking commie butt Prez....we love it!"
"I believe you....demos and rinos and every news media outlet running with the story as if it were true....do not ever trust them....they are low gutter, sewer rats."
I don't care if its true....if Haiti wasn't such a shitholes the people would have gone home by now.
"The left makes you defend yourself everyday because they are toxic and have nothing else. Washington needs a back bone, not once has the left cried and you changed your message, well maybe once but the amount of crying they do is on a larger scale than we have ever seen before."
"dear lord, what ever was said was said in a private meeting.... I feel whatever was said was taken out of context and then blabbed to the media???  hello. just hello... wake up.  who ""quoted"" a ""private"" meeting?    I love President TRUMP.  he has already done wonders!!"
"Take a look at Haiti on a map, then look at the other half of the island! Haiti is socialist! The other half a republic! says it all really"
"Hahahahaha sure! And you had the biggest inauguration crowd, know the best words, know more about wedges then any other person alive(he seriously said this), oh and is a like a really smart stable genius! Hahahahahaha ....idiot"
"SPIES/TRAITORS/HATERS - record your meetings this way they cannot create FAUXnews about ""who said-she said-he said"".  Thank you for cleaning out the White House of the dirty FAT rats living in the swamp for years. <3 Peace and Love <3"
"Every meeting with or without Democrats should be recorded, not just for public, but because there are so many people in the shithole called Washington DC that are trying to undermine the POTUS and the people that voted for him."
"Who are the  leakers? It was a private meeting right ? TRUMP word against them , and I can't trust  CNN with nothing .....so wtbs either way it's cool"
"What is said behind closed doors stays there. Just add these weasels to your weasel list, and freeze them out of furure discussions with you of any form."
The words are always turned what ever he says no matter what and that is because they donâ€™t want to understand or want to come to truth about what he says. President Trump doesnâ€™t have apologize just because those people like to change around his words for their sake to print the fake news.
"The MSM is jumping all over this because they know that there is no collusion, and, the so called â€˜dossierâ€™ is a complete work of fiction. So, by u uttering the s word, youâ€™re providing them with something fresh!"
"Oh, I guess I'll believe you in this case because you always tell the truth. Or wait -- turns out I *won't* believe you because you *never* tell the truth about *anything.*Do everybody a favor and just SHUT - YOUR - SHITHOLE before you do any more damage to our standing in the world."
"â€œGive me your tired, your poor,Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,I lift my lamp beside the golden door!â€ù"
This is why Iâ€™ll never vote democratic again _Ÿ_·_Ÿè_â€çâ™‚ï¸èlong live the Donald â€” this is from a 43 year old Blackman living in the inner city. Donâ€™t be fooled white people there are many like myself that love the President.
"Everyone is out to get you except the 63 million that voted you in , keep doing exactly what you are doing , donâ€™t budge an inch , we Americans have your back , AT ANY COST."
_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
MAGA
You are wrong. Some of us voted him in and live in regret!!
Angela Dawn so be it
"If he woulda went on tv and said what they are accusing him of I admit I would have been very disappointed.  If,  and I say if because I believe 0% of what the media and democrats say, he said it behind closed doors so what? I believe in the merrit based immigration system.  This country has it's own real problems and we have been wanting someone to fix serious issues right here for a long time. I have no problem with America first policies."
"Mr. President, you are making it very difficult for this life-long conservative to continue to support you.  And I know that there are millions of others like me.  Please think twice before you speak, and then don't speak until your subordinates have cleared you to do so.  You are blowing it for conservatives, Republicans and your faithful followers.  Your ego and mouth will be your undoing if you do not change immediately."
Where is Lindsay Graham and John McCain and Dock Durban on this? They were at the meeting. Iâ€™m amazed that so called good people are quiet. He said it He now denies it. Someone stand up and refute his denial. Americans are entitled to the truth.
"Unfortunately, you have conveniently avoided what you DID say...as to the ""shithole"" remark.  PLEASE exert some self control.  I consider you MY PRESIDENT.  In my view, character does matter.  Please consider this.....Thank you!  MAGA"
Mr. President I sincerely hope you are able to maintain positive presidential composure in dealing with the negative attacks. Positive attitude and actions will always win over evil and we should never resort to judgement that demeans any peoples and to use profanity also leads to judgement relative to a lack of intellect. I still have hope in you but there is much work to do!
The dems need to get a grip on things and stop crying about every little word sad! Screw Haiti and every other country! USA!
"The liberal media will take anything you say or ever have said and put their own spin on it. They make up, amplify and latch onto language that they hear and use all the time and act horrified at their own fake news created to attack conservatives.  Stand strong."
"haiti is a shithole , we should be handing out birth control there instead of money !  stop the problem from compounding"
"I think youâ€™d receive much more respect if you could show some respect for the human race.  I recognize you are trying to make things better for Americans, but disrespecting others causes everyone to ignore the positive things you may be doing.  Itâ€™s not just media bias, itâ€™s the effect of your words.  If you want people to recognize the job youâ€™re doing, stop distracting them and giving them reason to think youâ€™re ignorant. Many people want to come here to make a better life for themselves and their families; to get out of the difficult situations theyâ€™re in.  As president you should recognize that."
"What did the Clintons do to Haiti Ripped em off and stole money Mr President , We are more behind you than ever and trust your judgement The media is low and the Dems are nothing but evil and corrupt and unworthy of their positions We can help fix that in given time"
"Haiti would not be so poor if Hillary did not steal all the donations that were given to help their country.#MAGA_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸"
I'm sure there are good and bad Haitians that applys to everyone. But the country is a shithole now and was before the earthquake.
"You had it right, but why are these countries like that?  Could it be their leaders squandered their foreign aid into their own bank accounts and have had themselves raped by the BS Clinton Foundation that was supposed to also help them I wonder?  YUP!!!President Donald J. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, keep going and doing what you're doing"
YES
"From what I gathered, â€œHaiti is a hellholeâ€ù kinda true, yes?  Wasnâ€™t Clinton taking money for charities to help people living in â€œhellholesâ€ù?  Where is the money going?"
Donâ€™t believe you. Go back to videos of you campaigning you said things and then said you never said them - all caught on tape proving you are a liar. You created the lack of trust because your conduct and behavior is untrustworthy.
The Democrats were certainly happy when the Clintons raised and collected multiplied millions of dollars for Haiti and then didn't give them a dime. Just a thought.
"Wheres all the liberal concern about the Clinton Haiti fund, where 89 cents of every dollar donated went into the Clintons pocket???"
"Mr. President of USA, Donalld J. Trump shame on you if you say anything bad about Haiti or Haitian people. Remember we have fight for the independence of USA in Savanna. I have a good advice for you Mr. President If you have a good ralation with Haiti and the Haitian people why don't you give a chance to the  TPS people to become legal resident in the USA...I hope the congress of USA will take a look on this and do what is right for the Haitian, remember history is taking note..."
"The First Nation to escape slavery is a â€œshitholeâ€ù nation for a reason... because every other nation excluded it. You are a sad, sick, possibly mentally disabled individual that unfortunately has a very significant opinion."
"Ask yourself why is the media driving this. It's taking your attention away from the real issues at hand. Once again the media is driven by the dems and only want you to know what they what you to know.Don't waste our time with Shitholes, we all say it we have all have seen one in one way or another."
It's refreshing to hear about merit based immigration. We and other countries always help poor countries in need. I would really like to know the truth about what really going in these countries.
"Knowing that the main stream media especially CNN,NYT,rauter,bloomberg,politico etc to having PhD in fake news propagation,the news was like a water off a duck back with me,when it first came out.stay strong Mr president."
Do you think trump gives a dam about you?
my love for him is unconditional.
"If these countries are so wonderful why aren't the dems moving their summer homes there? Why aren't people emmigrating to Haiti, El Salvador, etc. It has nothing to do with color, Bahama isn't a problem, Aruba is not a problem, we allow Cubans in, People from African nations that are not in turmoil are welcome.  But why are the democrats so eager to use a play out of the communist manifesto. Destroy the middle class by flooding the country with poorest of the poor, unskilled labor who will take jobs away from american citizens."
Crooked politicians stole  Haiti's relief money to rebuild their country. They should  not have to flee to another country.
I think if you libs will let the president do his job that he has ahead of him we will all reap the rewards of a common America for the betterment of man kind no matter where you come from or what color skin that we wear lets get real people my thoughts
You don't have to defend yourself to your supporters.  We all know EXACTLY what you were saying.  We've been thinking it for decades.
"Mr. President, Thank you for your service to our great nation. Remember that Christians are praying daily for you and for America. Let the ""haters"" stew in their pessimism, while we stay in faith in God. _Ÿ™‚"
"Is that why Mia Love, one of your biggest supporters in the House and also a Haitian-American, actually called you out on your disgusting views? Yeah, lying about what you said fits right in with with your standard behavior."
What happened to all the money the Clintons promised Haiti after the earth quake? or was that another hurricane?
"If they aren't sh**hole countries, then why don't they stay in their own country?  And why aren't you Dems pissed off at Killary for not giving the Haitians the money she supposedly raised for them?"
"The poor Haitians especially know their country is sadly a shithole, which is why they in no way appreciated Madame Billy Bob going down there and selling their miseries to the highest bidders."
Yes record everything in the future. They are doing everything they can to make you look bad!. Unfortunately I'm seeing very gullible people that are being swayed by this propaganda.
Look at the idiots here! Ask the other Senators what was said. Only an idiot believes Trump after all his lies.
We know president trump. These awful people will say anything to make you look bad. Keep up the good work!
I think recording future meetings is an absolutely necessity when dealing with #fakenews = #distortedviews = #Biasedviews
I believe nothing the left prints. I listen to the President and decide for myself. Their brain washing techniques are for the consumption of the weak minded.
I wouldn't waste my time worrying mr. President with the liberal say about you just continue to do your job people are behind you there will always be Hypocrites and they're always be people moaning and groaning about things and trying to put people down who are doing something when they're doing nothing but causing division putting America First is definitely not what seems to be on their mind I wouldn't worry about it too much
"Colossians 8:5 Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. 6 Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.  7 You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived.  8 But now you must rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips.9 Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices10 and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.11 Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all..."
"I used to say stuff like that all the time, Mr. President Donald J. Trump.  It takes time and practice to overcome filthy language, but you can do it.  I know you didn't mean to hurt anybody; and I know you feel passionately about Making America Great Again.  You're doing a fantastic job.  Nevertheless, the American people need to be continually reminded that you are NOT like any other President in the history of this country:  admit your mistake, apologize, and let's get back to work!!!"
"Record your meetings and keep the footage under lock and key.  Especially if Lindsey Graham is present.I would say you were just being accurate if you HAD referred to these countries as ""shitholes"".  Democrats want poor, unskilled, unhealthy people to come here for the rest of us to support, feed, and take care of and driving a once great nation to mere extinction and into socialism.  We need intelligent people who bring allot to the table and will make our economy boom.  Not ones we have to take care of."
"I understood what you meant Mr. President. When you live in a place with extreme poverty, violence, warfare, etc., it is a crappy place to be! We get it."
The people who support you. Mr. President know that we can trust you to look out for us as best you can. We also know that the Dems. have been doing their best to block what you're trying to do for our country. So sad for them that their best just isn't enough to stop The Trump Team.
"Any one ever notice how almost all Trump supporters say God Bless? Yeah, because Jesus would love this shithole behavior."
"Whatever he said most working taxpayers are thinking,the reason he was voted in is because taxpayers are sick and tired of the United States being the dumping ground for the worlds jettisoned people"
I would record everything that is said in the meetings there are too many snakes in the grass. one problem is you have the left wing and the right wing but are controlled by the same buzzard. I would record everything those buzzards say.
"And yet not a single Senator present has come out and said definitively ""this did not happen.""   If this was false, they would have jumped at denying it.  It's true, and deep down, you all know it."
"Call them for what they are, these countries are corrupt socialist / communist shitholes, whether they are Belarus or Haiti, not a racial issue, it is what it is."
"Itâ€™s just another liberal, dem, anti-Trump media distraction. Mr. President, you are doing an awesome job of making America great again!!! God is with you...and so are we the people!"
Record all meetings. The dnc media and the haters have already proven over and over and over that they will say and do anything.
So you want to kick out the bad hombres but you love Haiti? Seems like you are talking out both sides of your mouth
stupid comment...You let the hombres live with you...
John Bellanger my point is he is limping everyone from Mexico in this term. Not all of them are bad. Families being separated and deported. They are so of the hardest working people.
John Bellanger  not all people from Mexico are bad. He is lumping them all in this category. In fact they are some of the hardest workers. He is separating families
Not all people crossing the Mexican boarder are from Mexico.
"Mr President, don't let the moronic democrats and liberals get  the best of you!   That's their plan!!!  Seek God's face and wisdom in all you say and do!!!  The saints are praying!!!!"
"The Dems double crossed you, Mr. President.  I don't use bad language, but their little trick to play you for a fool even causes me to want to cuss.  It is odd that only the Dems and RINOS were able to hear the S___hole remark.  They didn't mention it until they had a little time to concoct their story.  They were so upset to learn that you are not foolish enough to fall for their scheme.  I had never heard that word before; just hellhole.  Several news people have used the word ""hellhole"" in talking about this.  Is one of the words really better than the other?  Regardless, it should be no big deal deal if you said it or if you didn't.  Everyone is so easily offended anymore - everyone but you.  God has given you the grace and strength to allow words to roll off you ""like water off a duck's back""  Keep walking in God's grace, and He will keep you.  Things will boomerang back on those who seek to harm you."
"Merit Based is Merit Based.. Doubtful that Any of those countries have many Merit Based Immigrants ready to travel..  I'm 100% with President Donald J. Trump on this one..  When I voted for him I knew he wasn't a polished speaker.. and if you look around the world.. Not too many leaders out there are what you'd call Presidential..  Besides the President laid the ground rules for the deal he was looking for, It was like going to the Dealership to Buy a New Car and they wheel out this 2002 Dodge Dart with rust and try to convince you it's the best deal your going to get..  Yeah, I'd be pissed too..  America should be Pissed.. Lindsey Graham is a Fool.."
Those countries are s****hole countries.  Don't care how our President talks..acts...he is the only President that has put US first for a very long time.  He is trying to clean up American mess.....leave the man alone...he and his family are working for free!  God Bless this country!
"Oh, can you get $20 million of your own money to Haiti when the hurricane hit. Weâ€™ll never see that on mainstream media."
We have laws in this country why are we going over and over in force them and stop this no wonder Trump is up set with daca
"Show me the last time someone smuggled themselves into a gas tank to cross the border into Haiti.. I'll wait."
"I Remember that one of our Democratic Presidents [LBJ] made a statement that included: loose shoes and a warm place to S__t.  I do not recall any commentary in the press about those remarks, so what is the problem?"
"The CF built how many schools, Public Services are very poor, and just how many children are better off....Haiti might say bad words too! [[STICKER]]"
The president comments are not discriminatory and never was but it is very rational thinking with America first in mind. There is nothing wrong to say that we have enough people from one country and we need to stop importing them. We can not be open door to move Africa and Arabic countries into America to keep it flooding in. It would not be named America but some African or Arabic country. The president wants to find a balance and put America and American values first.
"Keep doing what you do and saying what you say.  You're saying what middle-class Americans have been saying for years. You speak our language.  Just remember ""Don't trust Dems""  They are out to get you every day!"
"For calling African countries s***hole...i stand with trump, because African countries need to be colonize again especially Nigeria...we don't have leaders except cow's in power of authorities..."
"Mr. President, perhaps you need to remind everyone how the Clinton Foundation prospered while Haitians suffered and how they used earthquaje funds to enrich themselves while leaving the Haitian people hanging."
seriously who hasnt watched something on TV or driven by a neighborhood or a house or a place and said outloud or in their head man that place is a shithole... unreal the amount of energy people put into meaningless crap...
"I say, in order to qualify for DACA, your home countyâ€™s Governmentâ€™s highest ranking official shall have to admit his country is a â€œSHITHOLE.â€ù"
"""Give me your tired, your poor,Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"""
"Well,that is more uneducated people to come over to live off of tax dime.   What the president should do is to stop welfare and relocate those people o where we need them. (Work the fields but pay them this time. I heard that they donâ€™t have people to work slaughter houses,well thatâ€™s a job)..."
Please record. They already lie about everything you say. They need to be videoed and held accountable for every libel and slander they commit. Pretty soon they may find a ton of themselves in prison for their involvement in more than that.
"Start recording every time they show up, course IF in the event any of it would be deleted, they will use that to Impeach you. Democrats are the MOST evil people on Earth"
Describing a place is not the equivalent to describing a people; although the place may be representative of the government which represents the people.  So deal with it.  Happy with our US President Donald J. Trump!  #MAGA
Did he use the sh reference? Iâ€™m only asking because a lot of people believe he said that but Iâ€™m thinking that it was just all a big lie
"Cheryl Nick Moore,  I'm not really sure.  Never heard him say it."
"he seems to be out of touch with reality, and believes that if he says it- that will make it so.  Numerous persons in the room heard him - not likely to mistake those hateful words.  To continue to deny it just makes it worse."
"Good idea mr President, no matter what or how you say anything, they will twist your words , evil people trying take you down! Besides we know Clintonâ€™s took Haiti down after earthquake thatâ€™s why Sâ€”-hole!!! Never got proper aid, still in tents! WHY??? We know but nothing is done!!!"
"While it would be nice to have a respectful Congress and Senate, today with all the first grader infighting, it's just not going to happen.  Not because its wrong, but because the liberal, spoiled, unrespected news media is going to run every story, no matter how small minded into the dirt.  Even someone picking their nose and wiping their hand on their own pants, would be a front page story and expounded for hours on in in the media."
"I'm suprised Trump didn't kill himself, let alone say a bad word.  Imagine being in a room with Democrats and trying to get anything done!  Talk about ""Mission Impossible""."
"This whole preteen drama party that the corrupt media have been engaging in is just a distraction from the real issue. The real issue is the fact that the Democrats tried to ram through another immigration bill that favors undocumented aliens over U.S. Citizens. They were disappointed that President Trump actually read the bill, including the fine print and did not fall for their dishonest and disingenuous tactics."
"Please record everything.  Especially the dems, put a camera on each one to record.  You know they will lie and twist your words."
I find it amazing that every day there is a controversy! Many in a room hear one thing and the next day it is denied that it is said while many times it is on tape . It must be fake news which is a term I never heard before last year
"TRANSPARENCY is everyone's Friend... except those WHO INTEND deception, DIVISION, Distractions... oops, sounds like you & yours, your cabinet & majority of the GOP. Try honest transparency with diplomatic principles/Compromise for things that HELP more than they HARM. You're harmful & unhelpful."
"Yes, record everything because they will use every word against you. They are a nasty lot, that coming from their own mouth. The nasty woman label they gave themselves was quite appropriate."
"The Liberals just don't like your honesty, and the Clinton Foundation destroyed that country like they do unborn babies everyday via abortion."
Yes president Trump whatever you do you need to go in with recorders document everything you write everything you say because in today's world especially in the White House the Senators the judges you can't trust any of them yes there might be a few out there that you can trust. But be careful we got a lot of crazies out there a lot of people who need psychological help and if they believe what they believe I don't know I just don't know God help them that's all I can say
"I don't see anything prejudiced about calling a hurricane destroyed, earthquake destroyed, flood destroyed, war torn destroyed country, city, town or place a ***t-hole in fact. ""If"" he said ***t-hole perhaps he should clarify what he meant. I took it as referring to the condition of the countries.....NOT the people. I dispise how eager some  people are to interpret the worst or fabricate a different meaning because of their own personal agenda's."
"The demorats canâ€™t complain about the gains our Country has made in last 12 months after 8 years of the sorriest President ever, so they dig for dirt. Telling truth never hurts!!"
"Delusional disorder, previously called paranoid disorder, is a type of serious mental illness called a ""psychosis"" in which a person cannot tell what is real from what is imagined. The main feature of this disorder is the presence of delusions, unshakable beliefs in something untrue or not based on reality."
At least Clintonâ€™s brother in law is making money supplying all the imported rice to Haiti Since the earthquake.
The man speaks his mind.  I would rather hear the truth than be lied too. I don't want political correctness.  Nobody should  (in my opinion )
"People in third world countries need to stay in their home countries. Itâ€™s not satisfactory to run from required effort. People in third world countries should work on their own countries. Great rewards wait for them if they are willing to put forth efforts and work for it. Any society can model themselves after The American Society as Western Civilization."
"No need to explain yourself to us, we knew exactly what you meant. The five year olds on here, that require pretty words need to go back to their safe spaces."
"All the liberal left that do not believe some of these countries are shitholes, please help them out.  They are just a plane ride away.  Go spend your money and help them climb out of their hole.  Tourism is good for all countries.  We all love to go sit on a beach, and many of these holes sit on beaches.  Take in the culture, food, and all they have to offer you. Spend, spend, spend your money and help them.  My travel advice is free!"
"I've lived in countries just like he has described,  but loved the people. They can't help what their country is...their government is socialist/communist run. Try living in one of these communist countries then come back and  see if you're still wanting to change America. Educate yourselves!"
"I love and Trust You president Trump. Yeah it would probably be very wise for you to start recording the meetings. They're after your head, I thank the Lord Jesus Christ that he's protecting you. You, your family and your Administration are continuously in my prayers. Thank you president Trump for making America great again!"
You are a POS. We know how much you lie... and then say I never said that and get your cronies to back you up. Please resign... you are a total embarrassment to our country. Move to Russia I hear your liked there.
Go Trump! Best President in current history. _Ÿ‘ç_Ÿ‘ç_Ÿ‘ç
Get help please.
"Picture living in a straw hut, no electricity or running water.  Picture sending your kids outside to pee and poop every time, and picture ADULTS doing the same thing out of necessity.  No jobs, no way to become successful.....the rich ignore the poor...."
"In the first place Mr. Trump, if those country's weren't actually: Shitholes, then nobody would want to leave and come here.  Even if you did not say it, it is actually TRUE."
"Why even waste your time addressing all these phony distractions, Mr. President?  Don't even dignify their nonsense with a response - you have more important things to do than recognize the opposition."
"You cannot trust any of those back-stabbers!  Their goals do not, in any way, include the safety and prosperity of Americans!  They cast slings and arrows because their intent is to destroy this presidency, at any cost, by any means, and lying is what they do best, second only to cheating."
"Hey Peter Heck, have you ever visited those third world countries for vacations? Why not?  I know I wouldn't because they are shithole countries, would you feel better if they were called hellholes?  Why are people leaving???  You snowflakes are so self serving as long as it fits your agenda.  Where you in the room?  As far as criticism goes liberals are the leaders in getting their hackles up!!!  Amazing!"
_Ÿ‘ç
"Man hard at work and constantly being harassed for every little thing.  He calls it like it is, period. So glad he is in the White House. That's all that matters."
Please record all meetings moving forward with an official Trump approved source so we can refer back to it later with zero flip flop. Have a backbone and own up to your words.
Well had Hillary actually gave them.the money she raised for them instead of doing little to nothing they would be better off.  How come her money laundering scheme isnt shut down yet ?..and why isnt she behind bars? So many have done less crimes and are spending years there. She seems untouchable....why?
Record everything from this point on. I mean everything. No need for leaky staffers in the same room with you . You deal with with the congress no one else and for the love of God pull that Jim Acosts press credidentials and rid him of the press briefings.
"Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early lightWhat so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet waveO'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?"
"You have to question who leaked this and what was their motivation. First thing that comes to my mind - Dems needed something to take away the praise that was being given to President Trump. I would have to think long and hard about these statements.  To turn a meeting between Republicans and Democrats who came to talk about DACA and were actually making progress, into something that probably was not even brought up."
trump we knows better. and u are a man with a big heart and loves all and treats all the same. . its just your haters cant handle it. alone with their evil god .  continue to stay strong and positive    . life is good and for God children things going to get better and be alright ..anyone ask who did we can always say God did it . we truly  serve a mighty good God
I hope you did say it!  It's true!  It is freaking true!  None of these supposedly offended liberal elites would set foot in any of these countries without a private army of body guards and who would blame them!
what you pepole are saying about the clintons and haiti is what trump is doing to the usa and very proud of it  wake up trump suporters read between the lines
Lier always will be explaining himself. Nothing is made up by the dems. This bull he says to his supporters. CNN is a respected global network and reports to the world and nationwide. CNN tells always told the excruciating extraordinary truth. The way it is. Realize that.
Dems thought they had a deal with Trump on comprehensive immigration reform and discovered to their dismay that they didn't - Dems lashed out.
"â€œIt was miraculous. It was almost no trick at all, he saw, to turn vice into virtue and slander into truth, impotence into abstinence, arrogance into humility, plunder into philanthropy, thievery into honor, blasphemy into wisdom, brutality into patriotism, and sadism into justice. Anybody could do it; it required no brains at all. It merely required no character.â€ù â€• Joseph Heller, Catch 22"
"why are people so much more concerned about words over actions.  Trump never professed to be a smooth talker but rather a straight shooter and it drives CNN CRAZY!!! They cant get him on actions, while they ignore the real illegal actions of their party, but are crucifying him on words. Sorry - the harder you try to demonize this president the more I like him. The enemy of my enemy is my friend."
"I would like to know... when we foot the bill for all these Americans going there.... exactly what do they do?   Are they teaching them how to improve their lives.... everything from how to be productive and get some kind of industry going.....  and simpler tasks like, growing a garden, building shelter, using birth control... efforts toward becoming self sufficient and improve situation."
"If you legalize cannabis, it pays for the wall with suppressing profits to Mexico, and they pay for wall inadvertently.  And always before our farmers grew it to support our country when being intimidated by tyranny and fascist. Now we know it cleans the soil of toxins better than another plant.."
"So the meeting participants left their meeting with you, huddled up in the hallway, and hatched a plan to lie about what you said?  Really???  In case you were unaware, there were many witneses in the room, AND no one from your administration said that you didnâ€™t say it last night!  Come on, now, how stupid do you think we really are???"
"You asked....you are not just stupid, but brainwashed"
Alysia Brook Sawyer-Dale  I think you can just keep drinking the Trump Kool-Aid. Brainwashed? Trump followers have take that condition to new heights.
You have a wonderful relationship with your own imagination and that's about it.  Everything else is just a sham.
"Obviously, Trump just might resort to have a recorder on all day every day and that would also record what others say to him!!  Surely tired of all the lies said by progressive liberals and the RINOs who do NOT want problems solved.  Well, hey...if problems got solved, then what would politicians run on the next time!!"
"The Desparation of the Liberal Democrats is nearing self destruction and to the point they truly believe in what they say!   Democratic Party is now of one of ""Hypocrits & Two Faced Liars"".  How Honorable!"
Yeah But when a place is a Pie Hole What do you call it . ?A pie hole. Now that America is Great again every other place looks like that. Ask the Liberals if they are Disturbed ?
Shithole.
"I do not have the flu, however, I am sick to my stomach reading the comments that have been posted still in support of POTUS45. Every post is nothing but rehash the lies told by Trump during the campaigns and the falsehoods fostered on the voters by deep pocket Conservatives. Most posts comment concerning Hillary and Bill Clinton stealing money that was donated for the rebuild of Haiti. The lot of you have only listened to the trash talk of the campaign. Do your own research. According to every document, the Clintons have never took a cent from the Clinton Foundation. Ignorance is your problem, and it is YOUR problem. It takes less than a half hour to fact check the comments that have been made. If you need a start, go to: https://www.factcheck.org/2016/10/a-false-corruption-claim/ I am not saying that Hillary and Bill are white as the new fallen snow, but they sure as hell not soot black that the Conservatives paint them. There is no doubt that they are infinitely more honest than POTUS45."
Unfortunately fake news is like trying to put the toothpaste back in the tube. Some people will believe it no matter what.
"Even if you record it, dems will twist it.  Look how they twisted everything you did and said in Puerto Rico after the hurricane."
Democrats looking for another diversion from the fact that a witness to the Clintons fraudulent foundation has been murdered!  Wake up. People.  The Dems are desperate. They will take anything our President says and will twist it to their convenience
If (big if) the corrupt governments in these 3rd world nations could be replaced....MAYBE...those countries would have half a chance to improve. Come to America legally.
"The democrats are not for America,they never have been,the will tell you one thing to get your vote and do the opposite after they get your vote,prime example is Comrade Obama, if you want to keep your doctor you can, Nancy Pelosi if you want to see what is in this bill you have to vote for it. This has been going on for decades, the black voting base, seem to not care if the democrats are blind siding them every chance they get. Even the illegal immigrants will see that the democrats only wants their vote after that you mean nothing to them, they are the democrats you voted for.. #MAGA"
"Durbin and others are pulling the race card again, as usual. They have nothing else!! Saul Alinsky tactics used by them to personally smear their apponents when they have nothing to counter the policies. Durbin is disgraceful and untrustworthy."

Why should be we burdened with them"
You should record all the interactions with democrats.  Specially when it is a topic they will try in every way to make You look bad.
"We don't really care sir ! Those left wing nut jobs can pretend to be offended by coarse words all they like..I personally would love to hear you tell them all to just shut the F@#* up and do their jobs !! How Sarah Sanders holds back from doing this at the so called, press conferences,is behond me ! Looking forward to 7 more wonderful years of your leadership!!"
"MAGA !!! If you must then record them. The dirty politicians of both parties just want you to fail and are not for the people of THIS country but for the greediness of the politicians. I consider the source of the conversation that by all means was private. Durban reminds me of little Nellie busting a gut to go tattle some tale. I have no respect for any of them but I love everything you are attempting to get done,"
"The media are making such a big deal because someone said you used the ""s"" word, yet Robert, the big movie star used such foul language against you with the ""f"" word that they had to bleep every other word. Please do not meet with the weasels again without it being recorded. You are above the trash, so please keep your language upbeat."
Would be nice if we could believe your denial but you're a proven #liar and we can't trust anything you say. #unfit #shame #fakepresident
"Actually, recording EVERY meeting in Washington DC is a great idea. If it is done for the 'Public' then the public should be allowed to hear who said what in full context, not just the tidbits that get 'leaked' to the MSM  by the disgruntled members."
"We KNOW you are a kind and good man Mr. President_Ÿ’™_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸AND...We love when you tweet; it's the only way the MOMMYS can get the HATERS in their BASEMENT to wake up !_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚"
That is hilarious and so true.  Love it
Just think how much better off Haiti would be today if the miserable Clinton's hadnt plundered the relief monies.
New rules have to be set as to the behavior of the press. They are the rudest and uncontrolled at every press conference. Itâ€™s amazing that this does not happen when you see presidential press conferences in other country!!!_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
"You said shithole. Which actually came from your own mouth, known as the biggest shithole ever since the beginning of recorded history."
"The way to look at it Mr President is accept the liberal media are watching your every wrong word you say, every action you take say for example scoop of ice cream, criticized every member of your family, criticized  every programs and policies you desire for the good of Americans. They are blind to the positive things you have done so far for America. My take Mr President don't be bugged down by this vicious attack 24/7. This is clearly a distraction and diversion. Let's focus on rebuilding America which the former establishment and former administration was turning it into a real SHITHOLE in enormous debts, in quality of education, turning it into a Godless nation, into a socialist country, weak in global leadership, rampant in corruption,  confuse our younger generation of who they are through social engineering, elected leaders only serve special interest group rather than the constituents who elected them in office,  weak in trade and turning it into an open border by previous administration. The opposition (liberal media, the Hollywwood elite, the snowflakes, the socialist leaning Democrats) is not the WE THE PEOPLE voice. The will continue with their vicious attack day in and day out. Just like dogs on the other side of the fence just ignore them. Please remember why we voted for you! Let's focus on making this nation on the right track."
"I have said it over and over, until Africans begin to solve their problems without calling for aid from the western community, they will continue to play second fiddle."
"I donâ€™t care what was said in a closed meeting. Everyone deserves respect for private conversations, even a President. Words spoken behind walls do no harm to anyone. Only when words are written in law and legislature can they do damage."
"No witnesses to what President Trump did not say.  This is another smear and distraction from Feinstein and illegally leaking the document, whatever it was, and also distracting from our growing economy they won't admit to.  Go Trump!!  You are doing great."
Hey you just told the truth. Donâ€™t apologize. The clintons should be made to give back all monies they stole from them. Anyone complaining should go to Haiti and help this country. Donâ€™t ever APOLOGIZE to these demoncrats. And by the way to Nancy P. Where I live a $1000. Is a life changing event.
It really bothers me to see the President besieged like this.  I don't think I will ever vote for any Democrat again.  I once did in the Goldwater/Johnson campaign.  I don't think I would do that again.  To call them poor sports is putting it very mildly.  Funny when Obama was elected those who didn't get the candidate they wanted didn't carry on like this.  It was only when Obamacare was rammed through that the  voters who didn't vote for Obama rose up and created another Tea Party.
"Televise all you can Mr President.  Gets the truth out, your message out, press can't spin it as easily  Dems and establishment GOP will be on the record.  Set a precedent for future POTUS how to be transparent while keeping your promises.   Also educates the electorate."
"This is what happens when you remove the sugar coating from what you're telling the public. Some of us still appreciate the straight shooting. There's nothing to say that everything is going to be perfect in any democracy. You can please some of the people all of the time but not all of the people some of the time. Which leads me back to the question, ""How do you govern 300 million people. Have a nice day you Haitians. Hope you get your poop in a group soon."
We all know that these Governments are corrupt. But yet we send them money and aid  and nothing helps. Their governments get richer the people get poorer and we keep sending the money . And on one ever said any thing about this. They don't want to up set their government.The people are uneducated non skilled. Most of the here live on Welfare and food stamps.
"Been there, I have to agree, the capital, port au prince, along with the rest of it, is a s### hole"
Are we to find it shocking the Dems are making up lies?  It would be more shocking if they actually told the truth.  Lying is all they know.
librels lie they no trump not sayy this but he rite if he did. media lie day and nite. no body even know where this haiti is but all mad about it
"Why do dems continually want immigration of people who become dependent and a permanent burden, who can offer nothing to this country?  Because dems need a permanent underclass as their voter base."
"Trump SHOULD record meetings - then fake news CNN and Dems won't be able to twist words - if they try, just play recording and show them to be the liars they are"
"We don't know what president said or did not say. What is very clear is- this time, Presidenr Trump needs to take care of this curse on our society - illegal immigration- for good.Year after year liberal politicians talk about solving the illegal immigration problem andtrying to use it to their advantage hoping to win elections, instead of safety security or what is good for our nation or it's people.This needs to end. No matter how fantastic or sympathetic stories they come up with-. Wecan't talk about our high moral law and order society by making excuses,apologies or making American people feel guiltyby accommodating law breakers using law abiding tax payers money- Illegal immigrants entered our country by over staying visas or crossing the border. It's an insult to the intelligence of American people and recent law abiding legal immigrants, who came here following laws and patiently waiting in line.A good chunk of decent American people and a vast number of legal Immigrants who came here last three four decades, liked what Mr Trumphad to say about illegal immigration. During the last election they were the silent majority. When on the surfaceall polls indicated Hillary Clinton could win all fifty states by a landslide, that silent majority elected Mr Trump President I believe mainly on this single issue. No matter what liberals say about current polling, Mr Trump needsto stick by the promise he gave to American people and the silent majority will respond during the midterm electionagain, giving liberals the shock of their political lives."
"Really? As of Tuesday he's been caught lying 2,001 documented times since January 20th alone. A senator who was at the meeting just backed up that Trump called those countries shitholes. It's not about politics anymore it's about democracy and morals."
"Proof please, or it's just hearsay"
"Yes, please do provide your proof, Mr Puffer."
..... crickets .....
That's what I thought.
"Everything that the fake news media and the democrats are conjuring up to take this President down won't work and it will backfire, just like the Russia collusion witch hunt that has come to nothing after a year of investigation, but is uncovering the corruption and collusion with Russia on the democratic side! They don't get that God chose this man to be President and is protecting him - no one will take him down and everything they try to do to him will backfire!"
I suggest... No more closed door meetings with Democrats! Have FOX news come in and televise all proceedings and discussions.  America can see how Stu@id they really are and only trying to make sure that that Republicans do not win!  They would rather take the US to Hell than let the Republican party have a WIN for America. MAGA.
"Now that would get their goat! LOL! They themselves would be panicking if you started recording all your meetings with the Dems.! Bahaha! I'd love to see it, but make sure you warn them, cause you know they'd start Whining if you didn't! _Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜±_Ÿ_£"
Everyday it's something!!! It's a fake story from an anonymous source from a fake news source! President Trump has Our support!! This is another bogus story!! By now we're used to it... everyone is posting on Fake news!!! It's embarrassing...no audio no proof just more fake news!!! Trump 2020
"Mr President I had thought you always had your own cameras at interviews, so that when their  verse are broadcasting, you had proof of what you truly said.    But how can one protect themselves from being record without your permission..then just release bit and pieces of conversation  Sadly there no way, and with the internet  there  no true way to completely delete or do over.Thanks be to G-D who cover the multitudes of each of our sins, by the shedding of the BLOOD of JESUS. Each day however we all should embrace the best lesson from a children song!Be Careful, Little EyesO be careful little eyes what you seeO be careful little eyes what you seeThere's a Father up aboveAnd He's looking down in loveSo, be careful little eyes what you seeO be careful little ears what you hearO be careful little ears what you hearThere's a Father up aboveAnd He's looking down in loveSo, be careful little ears what you hearO be careful little hands what you doO be careful little hands what you doThere's a Father up aboveAnd He's looking down in loveSo, be careful little hands what you doO be careful little feet where you goO be careful little feet where you goThere's a Father up aboveAnd He's looking down in loveSo, be careful little feet where you goO be careful little mouth what you sayO be careful little mouth what you sayThere's a Father up aboveAnd He's looking down in loveSo, be careful little mouth what you say"

"we all say that about those kind of countries, and we know it, it has nothing to do with the people who live there , but how those countries are ran, those banana republic countries,  that is all, the left the liberals and dems try ti turn anything Trump says into something negative, if they honest  , which they don't know how they to would admit they think the same about those poor countries,"
Wow. When has it become fact when the Washington Post always uses anonymous sources. The Oval Office is supposed to be a place where any President can have a private conversation without any leaks. Once again the Press is really screwing up! Awful just awful
"""Probably should record future meetings"". Yes, you 100% should. The press being in the meeting for 45+ minutes earlier this week kept everybody honest. They couldn't just go out afterwards and make up stuff about the meeting because we all saw it and knew what was REALLY said in the meeting. It was great too!!! Really enjoyed that."
"I believe what the people in the room said. There was NO need for THEM to create this strife, and you are only playing to your base, which is shrinking. There is no good reason why Senator Durbin would come out and make that ""sh*thole remark unless it were absolutely true. And you have said other things in the past that makes us believe this one RIGHT AWAY, no doubt in my mind you said it. So me thinks thou dost protest too much! Waaaaaaaay too much!"
"Yes, President  Trump should have everything recorded  by 3 separate sources. He is under incessant scrutiny by hordes of agendized haters who are just looking for anything to attack him ... he has more important matters to deal with than this nonsense."
"Liberals only know how to lie, when we catch them they shall be fired from any government job they have-explishly any lawmaker!  No retirement nothing but a bye bye wave out the door!  That too goes along with any media lies-they lose their FCC lic if they do not remove the reporter making up the fake news!"
"You say derogatory things ALL the time. You humiliate and demean others on a daily basis. You LOVE it. You thrive on it.  I thought we had a merit-based system for the presidency. Evidently not the last election. People didn't do their homework. You fail miserably in knowledge, experience, character, honor, morals and ethics."
"Actually we did do our homework.  That's why a murderous, treasonous,  evil thief isn't in the Whitehouse."
"I feel sorry for you Donald.  It must really be hard trying to find loyal people.  I think that is a thing of the past.  I for one think you are a great President.  May God bless you, buddy."
"What is wrong with you people?  Who cares what you call a country?  We have democrats in this country calling anyone and everyone Nazi, threatening our president, rioting, burning businesses, leaking government classified info.  And you are worried about calling countries, who do not support themselves, live off of our handouts and hate us, names?  Something is wrong with your mental condition."
After the bipartisan meeting on DACA and the bipartisan bill on drugs being signed into law the idiots are at it again seeking to divide. It just makes you all look that much more silly especially knowing what the Clintons did there. Or shall I say didn't do?
Yes. Record everything & let the American people see it so we will know who to vote out & who is causing all the drama! We need to know who is against us.
I would definitely start documenting these meetings ! Obviously there are still leakers and people looking to do harm to our legislative process . I don't hear anything about Pelosi saying the five white guys refering to GOP Senetors on any channel except Fox !!!!!
"If those hellhole nations aren't that bad at all why don't this expensive economic refugees just get up and go back home where they obvious belongs and when their hunger will knock them down their fake national pride will always lift them back up once again, ah duh right  ???"
They will stoop to any level to try and discredit you but they forget those of us who put you in office are not as stupid as they may think and weâ€™re not falling for their BS any more! Had that for 8 years now weâ€™re moving on to better things and if they canâ€™t get behind what that then theyâ€™ve got deeper rooted issues they need to deal with!!!!
"Many immigrants do not want to work, study and want to live at the expense of government, but many immigrants want to work, study and look for opportunities that, in their countries they don't have."
"Fake News... destroy Donald J. Trump at all costs... that's what the media is all about today. Know what I use the so-called mainstream media for these days? When some major event happens, I tune in for the on the scene coverage. Ain't many commercials popping up during that. Soon as they start to I'm out. I won't help fund their BS."
That is the only way Mr. president...record all your conferences and meeting....they will twist everything you do and word  you say.... cause you are doing a good job....trying hard to  have a bipartisan solution. But as usual the democrats and RINOS will be resisting and against you. They don't want you to succeed.
"You donâ€™t have to defend yourself to me either! Gone are the days when we couldnâ€™t tell it like it is, for fear of offending someone. Third world countries are shitholes - their people are all trying to come here for â€œa better life.â€ù What does that tell you? And why would immigrants from those countries be offended? They left their home countries for a reason."
Yes you probably should. But Haiti is a shithole because of the clintons so even if you did say you would be right
"Why donâ€™t these high and mighty ones leave their mansions and go vacation in these places ? I donâ€™t agree with the wording that was supposedly said at all, but those screaming the loudest in disgust wonâ€™t lift a finger or care about the people living in this places ."
"Somewhere someone has a record of what you said - even your very own if they are decent people would NEVER support your statement.  However, there are still ""good"" people and ""christian"" people who will defend, support and make excuses for you.  No good people would ever defend what you say or what you do ( grab women by the genitalia) and somewhere along the way, they ( your supporters) are going to have to make a choice."
"You have millions of people who want to be your supporter but you seem to be trying to make it as difficult as possible. Shut your fat mouth and do the job we elected you to do. No more. No less. Grow up and shut up."
Soooo disrespectful!
"You twit, that's exactly what Trump is doing! He's doing his job as POTUS. He's fixing everything the effing Clinton's and Nobama screwed up. He's bringing to light all their indiscretions, lies and deceit. It can't be any clearer. Crikey,  quit your whining, shut your mouth and open your friggin' eyes. Grow up."
"Patty Cake dude, I'm a Trump voter and I'm embarrassed that I'm lumped in with people like you. How is calling Haiti a shithole changing a single thing Obama did? Call me names all you want...you're completely missing the point."
'Ortiz'....afraid of deportation?? Trump IS doing exactly what he campaigned on...but the dims and some reps block his every move best they can! Like this article...meant to harm the president! Trump said he never said 'shithole'...I'll believe him over the mainstream media!
"Dude, done your homework yet?"
Patty Cake on what? Wether we agree? lol you tard. You still don't get it.
I'm the tard? Bwahahaha_Ÿ_£
"Don't worry Mr. President, you just asked a valid question that has been on the minds of the Majority of the American people for years."
"The insults and all manner of opposition this man got from the start, the ridiculing of him is exactly what catapulted him to success. Like a bully and his victim!!. The more you mess with him in the mist of great, good deeds, the more you glorify him!!. Idiots, when will you learn!!!"
"Yeah....and Norwegians don't want to come here anyway, their country is better.....the words are disgusting, but I wasn't there and there is no recording...so we will leave it there...based on your past rhetoric, it is believable, but many things are just as some things that happen are unbelievable....that being said, carry on Mr Prez, were watching you."
I think it is important to record everything because for right now there is no trust. Hopefully this wonâ€™t last itâ€™s been a year.
"If Haiti was such a good country why did the Clintons need all the millions and millions of dollars they said were needed, why couldn't they rebuild their selves if their economy was strong ,because they have to struggle to be a 3rd world country that's why."
"Of course the Democrats made it up!  Back when George W. Bush was president, they claimed that W called the Constitution ""a goddamned piece of paper.""  But they never offered any hard evidence to back up their claim.  It's the same thing happening with Trump."
"We know Liberals have  have done nothing but lie for a year now I have never seen anything like it Damm   they better prepare because 7 more years they will either learn to deal with it are they can leave I don't give a damm what they cry about next it's getting oldIlleagles gotta go time to put America back to work"
"Of course there's no trust with the Democrats. They have no moral compass and hate you, and will try to derail anything good you try and do, as well as flaunt anything they can put a negative spin on. All of us who voted for you know this. Quit trying to make the liberals happy. They will throw you under the bus EVERY time."
"It is obvious you meant their corrupt governments and poor economies. Totally agree that we cannot affors to take on their poor and low skilled laborers when there are Americans who need work. Also see you did not use the foul language. I respect that, but I honestly would not care if you did. - Brett Whaley"
"If only you didn't have a long record of vile words and statements, then more than 38% of America, and maybe even the rest of the intelligent world would actually believe you - but no worries, your base will still love ya. MAGA lol!"
"Well said Mr President!! Iâ€™m cuban and can testify that Cuba is a shithole! Not offended at all!! Maybe we can fix this immigration drama now, jajaja every offended person have to return to their â€œparadiseâ€ù countries! They donâ€™t need to be here if everything is perfect, right?  âù_ï¸è_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸âù_ï¸è_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸ #MAGA"
But it's okay for liberals like Tom Perez to use the F word during their speeches. That's perfectly fine!
I live in Illinois. This state has been ruined by Mike Madigan and his friends like Dicky Durbin and Cheri Bustos. Theyâ€™re the epitome of cronyism. This stateâ€™s government is corrupt and everyone who lives here pays for it. I donâ€™t believe anything Dicky says or his God- daughter Cheri Bustos.
"Quite frankly, I don't care if you did.There ARE, in fact, $***hole countries, and no, we don't want their poor and tired masses.Is it sad for them? Yes.Do we have our OWN poor and tired masses? YES.Let's take care of our own - especially kids who are victims of circumstances beyond their control - before taking care of the rest of the world."
"The questions are, (1) Do you believe he called these countries shitholes, and (2) if so, is it in any way excusable? For me, the answers are (1) Yes, due to multiple on-the-record eyewitness accounts, and (2) No, it is so far beneath the dignity of the office of POTUS that it would have been unimaginable in the pre-Trump era. What anyone else may have done at any other time is not relevant to these questions."
"I think its a good idea for Trump to record and let all them know he is(wouldn't want them to say he did it illegally because they would!) There would be no more lies and there would be proof on he said she said problems.IF it's top secret meetings he shouldn't have to record because it would be much easier to find out who leaked or said what to who!But I guess that would take the fun out of making a mockery of the white house!!"
Mr.president.your a smart man.you know the media is going to twist what ever you say and so do I.however for a while please limit your comments at all period!don't give them any more ammo to use.there hate is boiling my blood!!I want term limits that's why I voted for you!please get started on that.that would keep them talking for 7 more years.
He just said exactly what millions of Americans were saying and thinking. Why are these countries in bad condition? Some of them because of their own Governments. Why is it so hard to see that first we take care of our own people. Then by the grace of God we take care of others. Those countries are a mess. But so is ours in places. I am so glad these critics have such clear consciences and have never said anything derogative about anything. He is a man who calls it like he sees it. He was not being racial he was stating those countries are a mess and they are. We need to take care of our own mess first.
Let Keith Ellison go live in the Belgian Congo and see how he likes the country.I think his point of view will change.
"You probably should record future meetings.  Post them online so we have even more to roll our eyes and make fun of.  I think that's an excellent idea, proving once again the old adage that ""even a blind squirrel gets a nut."""
"Brothers and Sisters. Good Morning. This is the day the Lord has made. Hallelujah!!! Thank you Jesus. We Shall Overcome. The word of God tells us so. 1st John Chapter 4 verses 3 and 4 tells us all ""For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome. For whatever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that has overcome the world ___ our faith."" We are winners. We are triumphant. We are victorious but only if we obey the Father and His commands and do what is right. Dear friends doing what is right starts with us all being humble. Humble means to be gentle. We can all behave in this manner. The Bible tells us in Galatians Chapter 5 verses 22 and 23 the fruit of the Spirit. Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. We all can behave and be with the these good things. There is so much good we can do for one another when we are in agreement with one another. Their is so much we can accomplish when we work together and build one another up. We can empower and inspire one another by havong in the Father and faith in one another. We can live in peace, safety and security with one another. We can treat one another with respect, and honor. Love is the answer. The Bible tells us that love is patient and love is kind. We can do this brothers and sisters. There is no need to hate and despise one another. There is no need to insult and put down one another. There is no need to use harsh and abusive words towards one another. There is no need to persecute and punish one another. There is no need to spread fear and strife among brothers. There is no need to divide ourselves and fight with one another. We all should be in agreement with one another and in fellowship with one another. Anger should not be an obstacle nor a barrier. Our anger should be a way for to make things right. The Bible tells us in Ephesians 4: 26-27 ""Be angry, and yet do not sin: do not let the sun go down on your anger, and do not give the devil an opportunity."" This means your anger needs to be resolved quickly and peacefully. And we should not hold onto our anger. The devil wants us divided and wants us to fight with one another. No we must not allow the devil to control us. God the Father needs us to be active and attentive listeners. We need to think before we open our mouths. And we need to slow down our response. It is always the right time to do what is right. Reminder: No matter what your circumstances are. No matter what the devil says or does against you. No matter what you are experiencing in your life at this moment. And no matter what you see the Father has an answer for you. Trust in Him and trust in His mighty word. God the Father loves you with an everlasting love and He has both a purpose and a plan for your life. Make that quality choice dear friends. Choose life. Choose Jesus. Jesus is the hope of this world."
"Don't believe and never will at this point anything bad said about you. If anything they are hurting themselves, so much bashing, I don't even listen to it anymore!! Can't be bothered. To busy looking at all of your accomplishments! Thank you Mr. President!!"
"When will this slurring word mongering stop from the Democrats and their cronies in the press. I have watched American politics for over fifty years and have never seen such degrading, filth being thrown at a president before. yes Presidents have had their problems before but funny how memories are lost when it comes to the Clintons."
Awesome!! Record all meetings so the media can't make you look bad anymore. Maybe if your supporters actually saw how stupid you are they would finally believe it for themselves!!  Record everything  or broadcast it live so there's no mistake!! Idiot
You are a hateful liar who needs to resignâ€”see how your name looks on the list with Buchanan and Andrew Johnson.  You make me embarrassed for my country.  â€œSad....â€ù
"I feel sorry for you that you constantly are quoted by your own staff and some just won't go along with your words and keep your words silent. This is the highest job in the country and it's not your reality show. It's your job to bring the country, world together. The media does not fabricate. And  I pray you stop."
Delusional?
"Actions speak louder than words, Trump said something mean, The Clintons robbed Haiti relief money. Hmmm."
"Definitely record your meeting. Then you personally take the recording and lock them up. Trust no one. And besides, you are in private meetings. You should be able to express yourself anyway you choose. You have spyâ€™s that are going to dissect every word you say in order to take you down. The Democrats are desperate and Soros is spending big money to try and get you impeached. Trust no one and always carry a pocket recorder. MAGA"
"How about doing something for the Puerto Ricanâ€™s who were devastated by the hurricane, you do realize that Puerto Ricanâ€™s are American citizens and they donâ€™t, need paper towels, they need the same kind of help as much as the other areas of flooding were helped and where the hell is Fema?"
"Need a spoon full of sugar with your speech, mr President.  People get their feelings hurt, especially snowflakes in the left.  Just keep up the good work with the economy and bite your tongue when you have to, and you should be fine.  Peace."
"Yes, you should be recording. The CIA and FBI are. We all know exactly what Comes said. Both entities practice changing the wording of emails and recording to the point no one with any forensics can tell it's been altered. So yes, President Trump, your meetings should all be recording by someone working for you not for them."
"The demmos are so desperate to destroy you, its sick. And they call you ""crazy""! I'm sorry I believed the Fake News, I hope you can forgive me. God bless you Mr President, have a blessed weekend _Ÿ™Œ_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡®_Ÿ‡±"
"I don't believe anything the Democratic representatives say.   I am floored that with all the  illegal things Obama, Hillary, the FBI and others have done that they are not in jail.   Keep making up stories to deflect their corruptions."
zionists kept Hussein obama and HIllary in power
"So many things this Lier-In-Cheif blames on the media or â€œDemsâ€ù. Could it be heâ€™s just a stubborn lier who is incapable of taking responsibility and apologizing."
"We love you, President Trump!  Thank you for all your hard work.  We do NOT want those uneducated, unemployable folks coming here and going on welfare.  THEIR countries need to take care of their own people.  If folks want to come here, let them go through the legal channels.  Thank you and God bless you!"
"It was a private meeting, why aren't those who leaked this as hated for what they did as Trump is for what he supposedly said.  It is as bad or worse when a person cannot speak a word without someone broadcasting it.  Where is their civility?   I don't care if he said it or not, until the double standard that exists today and Hillary and her cohorts are charged for what they have done to destroy and corrupt our Country by deeds not words, Trump gets a pass too."
"If he said those things, that's not good.  The way i was raised being vile and disrespectful was unacceptable. If he did say thoses things, it's bad because he has lied. The way i was raised, this was and i would be punished. If i made excuses about how the other kid did the same or worst, I would still be in trouble. "" be responsible for your actions"". That was how i was raised."
"Under normal circumstances I agree with you wholeheartly, but these aren't normal circumstances."
Your lies are so apparent... you said it now try to deny the obvious... a stable genius wouldn't make such comments... you are the poorest excuse for a president we've ever had...
"American's who pay attention know about Obama's comment regarding Libya.  Our current POTUS is lying with every declaratory tweet.  Can't believe the cowardice of Cotton...he doesn't recall, Lmbo!  If a Senator can't recall spoken words less than 24 hours later he either slept through the meeting or is spineless."
"Have to love the simple minded liberals are clueless, hilarious and very dangerous. Let's just hope they continue to stay in their safe space and they keep believing their polls. Trump is absolutely Brilliant!!Trump 2020!!"
"The Liberals mentality is if you cant win you tell lies and make up what you think will turn people in their favor. This is the worse I have seen ever.  They are committed to continue and look for all ways to stretch and change the truth.  Only thing they forget, the citizens on the most part are wise to their tricks and all this nasty game playing will come home to bite them.  I have see this at local levels and many years ago too, but it does not work."
"So sorry Mr. President Donald J. Trump that you are having to constantly defend yourself. You are doing an awesome job and I am proud that I voted for you. Do not stop being you. Speak your mind, and defend yourself. And continue to do the work that we voted you in to do! MAGA!!!"
Clinton's stole millions from the people of Haiti during a time of great crisis. Not one shithole news agency reported it.
God love you Mr. President...keep fighting for all Americans and even if you used some bad language...it is probably the persecution never experienced by any President in our history!  You are under constant pressure...praying the lib a give you a break someday!  You are amazingly strong!  Go Mr. President!_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸âù_
"Prez, if u had used the phrase - â€˜3rd world countriesâ€™,  instead of the s word, no one would have said boo- everything would have been fine. Sir, Iâ€™m surprised you donâ€™t know this by now,  but you have to choose your words carefully, because the Dems are looking to bury you."
And worse than liberals/socialists is a Republican Congress that will not stand behind this president; everything must be politically correct. They never even wanted change; they either do nothing or ridicule his every syllable in the absence of action.  McCain is a liberal with an elephant badge. In fact the only true republican I see is Trey Gowdy!
DACA = Future Democrat votes! It will turn red states blue. DACA is a great example of how multitudes of people disobey the rule of law and said  law gets rewritten to appease said people that shouldnâ€™t be here anyways. Iâ€™m pro immigration just go about it the legal way. A law is a law is a law. Of course unless you are a socialist and that law doesnâ€™t fit into your future projection of what America should be. Communist
"I find it offensive that a US President cried on TV, told Iran we we're no longer a Christian nation, bowed to the leader of Saudi, asked the President of Venezuela to autograph his book, etc. The list goes on.So if a US President refers to a 3rd world country as a ""shithole"" I could care less. He's putting Americans back to work, and looking out for our best interest"
"I'm sorry Mr. President that you have to go through all of this crap.  The last president didn't have to go through all of this, I cant think of even one president that had to.  Keep moving forward.  Their lies wont take you down.    Be blessed Mr. President.  Obviously your doing something right.   <3"
"Well, I'd recommend recording ALL governmental meetings, period. It will be proof of what was said and will force everyone to think before they talk. These days, very few politicians are there to serve the country; they're there for their own political and professional gain. Neither democrats nor republicans can be totally trusted; almost all of them have a price when it comes to betraying their constituents if it somehow benefits them. Record the meetings; then make everyone who lies look like fools. And it will keep you on your toes knowing you can't just fly off at the mouth, even when speaking the truth or when no ill was meant."
"Glad you clarified that, Donald J. Trump.  So in other words, even if a country is a proverbial s***hole, you are still willing to work with the PEOPLE to make it better.  You are right also that the people and the place that they live in are two different things."
"It doesn't matter Mr.Trump what or how you expressed your opinion regarding the broken immigration situation, the establishment will interpret it according to their ""open borders "" globalist agenda, we are in a war internally, it doesn't matter  for them, they will use any trick or action to discredit you, they want you OUT, regardless, play safe,don't trust anybody, don't ever forget that the USA presidency was,is and will be the loneliest job in the world."
"Everyone knows you didnt say that.  It isnt your style of talking...and everyone who actually listens to you, understands that liberals are trying another tactic to internationally smear you."
Well that country after all really is a shithole! Nobody can deny that! So I agree why would we want them here then? Oh I forgot _Ÿ__â€çâ™€ï¸è We need more Savages! _Ÿ_¬
"All I can say is, if u said it maybe the truth can't b handled by such low tolerant crybaby dems.. If I were u, I would record every single conversation.. Plus there r a lot of foreign countries that r exactly that.."
"I don't care about something trivial like whatever was said. Especially when it interferes with what needs to be done. Stop dragging your feet Congress and solve the issue. In the future, yes either record the meetings or televise them so cheap political theater like this can't be indulged. Disagreements are expected. But enough with the divisiveness."
"President Trump I would record everything.  I was told once that ""if it ain't in the record it didn't happen"" - CYA for sure.  You realize you are scrutinized for everything you do, say, wear, eat, walk, talk, go, do - RECORD !  Apparently, you are never going to get a break at anything!"
Sir you said it correctly so that everyone could understand and also start talking about it because if you would've said these big words and sugarcoated it nobody would've paid attention! I'm glad you said what you said because it's true! Those Democrats would change everything for they are side so that they can look good and you can look bad but guess what we the people know better!
"You should of mentioned the SHITHOLE democrats!! BOX OF ROCKS what did you expect.  Never trust them, like this DACA deal......GET RID OF DACA."
"YES!!  Throw DACA out, and BUILD THE WALL!"
"I'm willing to give permanent protected to status to DACA, with no ability to vote in OUR elections, after they are actually vetted, and citizenship for any that have served in the military. In exchange, I expect an immediate end to chain immigration and the diversity lottery, FULL funding for our wall, and mandatory e-verify."
"We have already helped them in past ! Even the clintons, um, did..??  But, we have helped them, their gov is Badly corrupt, so thats the door the clintons Gladly stepped thru, to Take ! :(  So of course they won't trust. But also we can't trust them, Bad gov there, Taking from the people so they live poverty as result :("
"President D. Trump must read and re-read the history of his country. A group of about 1,500 freedmen, known as the ""volunteer hunt beers"" of Santo Domingo (future Haiti), fought in 1779 at the Battle of Savannah in Georgia, leading to the independence of the states United States proclaimed in 1776 without the consent of the English. This battle is considered crucial by many historians. These soldiers left the Catholic Church of St. Mark, Haiti. The street along the Church still bears the name of this US city (Savannah), it is contrary to the principles of recognition, it is they (Americans) who should have a street in our name."
"Ask the Clintons about the Haitians...or better yet, ask the Haitians about the Clintons. However coarse Trump's verbal delivery is, atleast he isn't trying to get rich on money that was supposed to be assistance for them. I guess to Democrats, Clinton's approach is preferred..."
"Their track record for lying is so bad, we don't believe anything the Democrates say! Thank you, Mr. President, for standing strong against the evil force that's against our country. Keep standing your ground as you keep your promises to the people and know we're behind you 100%!"
"Yeah but thousands of paranoid schizophrenics with self proclaimed powers of telepathy and espionage disagree... and the unidentifiable ""sources"" in their head have ""proof"" that you said this and said that... it's politically very incorrect to disagree with their delusions and auditory hallucinations... Just kidding! MAGA"
I think the UN are offended as Trump has exposed the UN for doing nothing and letting these countries turn into shitholes. Surely the UN have known about the troubles these countries were having but chose to ignore it. Instead pump more money into pretend global warming.
They didn't mind all that funding they got from us! We didn't believe any of that trash talk anyway. We know OUR president.  It does look like u will need recording during meetings n talks with these people.
having 12 brothers and sisters like the Chancellor of Haiti has...and many other families there... might be the problem.
"It shows what little brains he has, he should be kicked to the curb. Republicans what are you waiting for? He is destroying the republican party."
â€œ Little brains â€œ _Ÿ˜‚
One needs to find out who talked to the news media and said what they said.  I don't believe that Mr Trump would say anything like claimed unless it was intentional.  The person(s) who leaked the information should be fired and never allowed to do anything like this again.
This was just a creation to keep us from concentrating on the revelations coming out about our 4th Amendment rights and the truly evil things that have gone on against us.
I have this to say it took them days before they brought this out why would it take them this long with this juicy tidbit someone is not getting the story right and in watching the press conference with Sara our reporters repeated  many of the same questions to her as if they hadn't heard her answers or were just waking up from naps
"Many people have talked you about this fact.  You can't trust in any one, neither republicans.  This is a real fact, you are not popular with any politic; but the nation support you with their votes.  I know just one thing, God has been who put you in this position, and anything happens without his freedom, justice and commitment and purposes.  Donald J. Trump, God bless you with wisdom to govern this nation."
"Haiti is the way it is because of it's past government that failed them! Then add the blow of a natural disaster, the promises and tears used by the Clintons to give them aid that never arrived.....anyone remember Bill begging Americans to give them even just one dollar to help? All those funds created the The Clinton Foundation, of which Haitians did not receive a penny. They were once a thriving country for the Elites in their government only not the people worker bees. The people wanted Independence from Britian, when Britian gave up their control the people did not know how to lift themselves up from the only way of life they had ever known.....enslaved poverty. Sad, so sad but our President is correct....just ask any Haitian."
"Always bringing up the clintons, or the democrats. we get it you like to dodge issues, but no ones worried about them, literally every white guys argument is ""well hilary did this"" What does this have to do with anything right now? Ffs, this giant toddler needs to leave office"
The Democrats are rediculous how they act. They act like they are still in control. I can't stand to hear them continually run our President Donald J. Trump down. They say what goes around comes around. I hope it comes back on them all their rottenness.
Tsk...tsk...your President is an unworthy bigot.
"I see what your doing, and for those that don't know here's the answer. The best way to get two groups that don't get along to work together is to give them both a common enemy. He said he would take the heat and that is exactly what he is doing. I get it Donald J. Trump maybe one day other folks will."
"Trump is exactly right, NO TRUST!  We should be more concerned about the breach of privileged information in high stakes closed meetings than inappropriate words.  WHO in that meeting released what was allegedly said to the media?  All dialog must be viewed as confidential and respected by 'high-level lawmakers.' I call for the name of the person who repeated remarks from this closed meeting.  We need to know the name of the individual we cannot trust.  Otherwise, it should be considered a diversionary tactic to keep our focus off of the issues."
zionist right fund the marxist communist left. Expose the Talmud the root of the lies and deception. The only group you cannot critic or talk about. The dialogue must occur to build peace and to make things better for everyone.
"Keep striving forward..You're making a powerful difference. The media and Dems. are grasping for straws, Everything they thrown at you have failed. This too shall pass. Keep Roc n'em !!! And go build our wall. ~Cheers"
"I am so sick of the attacks against our president. If anyone had shown the hatred attacks against Obama the way they do to Trump, they would have been arrested for far less than what is being done here. No one wants to hear the truth of matters. Someone makes up lies and everyone runs with it as if it were the gospel truth without having seen any facts or evidence. _Ÿ˜¡"
"Mr. President You should start negotiations with all the African nations that decided to move their embassy to Jerusalem.Annex them and instantly you increase your black voter base and drive the complaining whining so-called self entitled â€œBlack Americaâ€ù Out..#MAGA"
"You're right!!  If it wasn't for Many churches,  and Christian organization s that still bring aide to these wonderful people,  many would not have water, healthcare,  shoes, etc..It is pathetic how their government is so corrupt. Their swamp has to be drained!! Too!!"
"Yes you should. If it were me, I'd say negotiations on DACA are over if every time you meet behind closed doors democrats are going to run to the cameras and make political attacks, what's the point?  They obviously are only interested in sabotaging the process. Sad that it's the democrats obstructing getting anything done for these kids. I guess you'd just have to let it expire and start deporting them."
"Anyone like candles? They are soothing & relaxing unlike what I keep seeing on my social media:Check out my link instead of wasting your precious time arguing & on the plus side they are 100% Soy Wax with no chemicals! _Ÿ˜‰https://www.countryscentscandles.com/store/tammyjennings2006"
"Sad that he has to respond to every thing the media puts out that is based on hearsay or ""an unnamed source"". They ALWAYS turn out to be completely false."
No matter what you say the media is going to twist it! I have watched many of your speeches and turned on the news afterwards just to see what they would say about it. They twisted everything you said and then said you said things that never came out of your mouth. Grrr!!!!!  Trump 2020!!!!
"News channel states that a single democrat made the claims while 2 republicans refute emphatically and another says he said his piece. So, sounds like 3:1 ratio to me. Considering Dems track record, I believe Donald Trump's version."
"Wow, imagine that.  A President that doesnâ€™t hold back, tells it like it is.  Problem is most left wing nuts canâ€™t handle anything that doesnâ€™t have a nice thick sugar coating.  Guess what folks, the participation trophy administration has left the building, so suck it up buttercup."
"Mr. President the dems wont stop at anything to make you look bad. Please be careful and with that bunch always cover your back because they are ruthless thugs. Be sure of who you can trust. I have a feeling if you ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with the peanut butter on top you would hear about the travesty of it. Good luck and we are with you and we appreciate everything you do , and all the bologna you have to deal with . I always hope you will think its still worth it. Thank you and we are so happy you are our President."
"Mr. President...please stop defending yourself against these allegations...your supporters do NOT CARE whether you made these comments or not. If anything, it only makes us more grateful that you are OUR President."
So what?  Hillary kept most of the money her foundation raised for the Haitians and Puerto Rico has been hoarding the supplies meant for the people.  There are bad people involved in both things but Trump is not one of them.
"Yep! You never said anything bad about the people themselves living in those places. But the places, their goverments,infrastructure and economy and such..well.yeah..those places basically are what you said...Everyone knows that... Even the people living there know that..which is why they are leaving those places and trying to come here. Thank you for not being PC about it , stating the obvious and calling those places for what they are."
"We should be allowing people in our country who can make it a better country, not just because they want to come here!1"
I don't care if you use words your enemies jump on while you are putting America first. It is the job of elected officials in D.C. to put America first and they have not done that job for many years.
Even if he did refer to some of the other countries as a s******* country at least he is not lying about it most of the other countries are s******* countries
"I don't care what this man would say or do, there are those who are just waiting to attack.  Those people need to get a life and give this man a chance.  He wasn't my first choice but certainly better than the others who wanted to be president."
You should care and you should  count the chances you gave or are planning to give. With children and in normal life would that would be 2-3. In my book those were spent long ago but maybe you count different.
He has his chance. One year. Anybody else would have been fired and imprisoned by now.
"Keep on keeping on Mr.President!! Real question is, why arenâ€™t the Dems and MSM worried about the human trafficking atrocities happening here and abroad?? _Ÿ_” Whose involved? _Ÿ_”_Ÿ§ê tick tock"
"After 10 years of them calling us teabaggers, and every vile name you can think of, their outrage rings hollow. Sit down regressives and shut up."
I wish Trump would understand that trust is a fading b4 our eyes honor and respect is on the chopping block. We lose them 3 things completely we are done itâ€™s over our foundation has crumbled. You canâ€™t build a great building on a weak foundation. Thank you Mr President _Ÿ™è_Ÿ’œ_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
"Mr President, even a successful career in the cut and thrust Worlds of the media and construction, could not have prepared you for a what you are experiencing now in an environment awash with some of the most disgusting reptiles known to man, best of luck, be yourself and you will win through."
We need to be very careful who we let in the US anymore. It doesnâ€™t matter where they are from what color they are we need to make sure we are not letting terrorist into the Country. Iâ€™m with you President Trump you are doing a great job! I will always respect the President and Vice-President because that is the right thing to do. You are doing the right thing.
"One negative comment to every 20 positive comments. Hmmmmm, We don't need phony polls and media gossip to know you will be re elected by a landslide. Most of the hard working people will vote for you.Keep up your hard work. America strong & America 1st."
"People can't accept the truth! They aren't used to it. If their countries weren't so terrible, they wouldn't be wanting to come here! What do people think, immigrants come to America and leave their wonderful life in their home country? If people would step back and think about the comment, it would make perfect sense. It's all the commentators that are stirring that big pot!"
"If all of us who never have said a vile word in our lives would throw a stone at our president, how many stones would be thrown.  I am not excusing vile words but come on now, be a man or woman, act like an adult.  Quit the childish rhetoric."
"There is nothing wrong with telling the Truth, after your comments were based on Observations !!   ""The Truth Hurts"" Doesnt it !!  Their respective governments need a wake up call...send in the UN to deal with it...we're tired give them a free ride !!"
"â€œAccording to Larry Nichols, Michael Wolffâ€™s book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, has already been proven to be fake. It is designed to give the media fake stories to run so that they donâ€™t get blamed for generating fake news. They can cite this book as their source. As a member of Obamaâ€™s War Room, Wolff is experienced in disseminating false stories.â€ù"
"Hussein Obama=Arabic, Sunni Muslim from Saudi Arabia no ties to Iran. Its a false front. The zionists kept him in power. Reinvestigate 911"
"Maybe he means that people such as those from Norway are less likely to have to go on WELFARE and food stamps when they get here! And the other good thing about most Norwegians is that most of them already speak ENGLISH...gee, you canâ€™t say that about most of those coming from â€œsouth of the (open) borderâ€ù, now can you? Doubtful that many Haitians speak English either!"
"Mr President if it wasn't a word out of order the Dems &Media would find Something else to distract from actually getting the Real work done. BUILD THE WALL...And if Dems can't do their Job...Send DACS families home!#âù_ MyPresident"
"We all know and agree these countries are shitholes but we are just too polite to express it that way. We are more tactfull.  I love Trump, he has done so much for us and tring so hard to do more, but his mouth and lack of patience is going to be is undoing if he doesn't take more time to respond more intelligently to situations instead of responding in anger."
I would not let that Democrat into any further meetings with you...also goes for Diane Fienstein. Recording the meetings sounds good to me. We deplorables are getting more and more fed up with the horse manure being spread by the left.
"Maybe America should focus on their crumbling infrastructure, ruined healthcare, veteran suicides and rampant homelessness before they call other countries shitholes."
Zionist bankers need to bring back the income they took from America
Wonder what Hillary thought about this poor Country!!  Look what she did to them and they want to talk about TRUMP!!!
"Even if you never said anything the liberals and Democrats would scalp you! The left are filled with hate and you are their convenient whipping post. We voted for you and appreciate how hard you work and the achievements you've made! Thank you for the tax cut!!! Thank you fir getting rid of M13, thank you for continuing to fight to build the wall, thank you for fighting to stop illegal immigration!!! Thank you for all the other things you have done to Make America Great Again!"
"Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republcain, was also part of the Oval Office sitdown suggested in a statement Friday that the President had said something questionable, but Graham did not directly say Trump had used the term ""shithole"" ""Following comments by the President, I said my piece directly to him yesterday,"" said Graham.Republican Sen. Tim Scott, the junior senator from South Carolina told Scott that Graham told him the reported comments are accurate."
If we canâ€™t believe the Republican senator in the room and that the senator took offense and personally talked to Trump about his distaste with Trumps comments who can we believe. A senior member of his own party called him out and verified that the reports of his comments were accurate.
A TV reporter tonight said that the senators who couldn't remember what was said should seek medical help for their early onset mental problems.
Scary part of this is the apparently large block of the great unwashed that agree with DJT.
"Say it that way the first time. Please, president Trump, stop tweeting. You will not be re-elected if you don't. Show your problem solving, negotiating side...not The crass side you show at home. This isn't your living room"
And no one died and made you boss.  Why don't you show your adult side and stop acting like a child who isn't getting her way.
Just like you I have every right to express my opinion here and will continue to do do. Have a blessed day.
"Haiti is a Shi.hole, thank the Clintons, just Google Clinton's Haiti. Is is not the people it is the govt against the people as always."
"We don't believe you.  Your comments will make it easier for China to expand their already massive influence in many African countries that are very rich in natural resources.  China grows ever more powerful and influential in the world and China is our biggest competitor.  We're sure that China's leaders, who are much brighter than you are, love you."
What absolute rubbish.  Just another libtard blowing smoke and spewing stale rancid garbage.
"Ida Lyon, research what China is up to in Africa.  Your comment is ignorant."
"There are deliberate and calculated plans to bring you and the government down.I don't need your explanation either to believe you.Move on! God is with you and will use you to achieve His goals.God bless you and America. Continue to make America great!"
Love you so much President Trump. You have done so much for our country. Iâ€™m so sick of these people making up lies about you. You have done more than anybody else has ever done and in only 1 short year. I think there should be punishment to anybody who knocks our president. Free speech is out of control. I think you are a wonderful man.
"The ones that caused to be made that way are the ones attacking the current administration for the comments that had slipped out because of the truth of what is going on down there.  Now, if those countries that are targeted accepts the situation, maybe that would be a momentum for them to at least do something instead of waiting for something."
I find the timing convenient the media take such a honorable time to show his respect for Martin Luther King junior and all his work and uses it to try to blemish President Trump this is definitely a new low for the Democrats and the media
"My husband immigrated in 1961 BEFORE the immigration law wa changed. He was required to have a skill, a job waiting, and a sponsor. Today, immigrants sell spots into America to their relatives and ""fiances."" Personally, I think the old immigration law was good for America because the people coming over were helping and contributing with skills."
"I don't care if you said it not, but unfortunately it is true. The Haitains can't help it and you weren't putting them down. We who know you know what your point was. Fact is, you are living in the middle of the biggest shithole of them all. Hang in there and MAGA!!"
"I always support the president in office and respect that position, no matter who it is. The best thing President Trump can possibly do is stop Tweeting and stop with the vitriolic comments and just be the ""boring President"" he said he would be if elected,  carrying out policy enactment. Continually inserting foot on mouth and giving the media fuelfor yet another week will always mar his legacy, no matter what he may accomplish."
"Trumpturd is a pathological liar, he said they were shithole countries, everyone heard it.  Thereâ€™s no denying Trumpturd has no sense of decency or decorum, or morals or integrity.  Heâ€™s made his fortune illegally laundering money for corrupt Russian oligarchs and other criminals.  Birds of a feather..."
Bless your tiny hateful heart.  YOU are the pathological liar.  Did you hear it?  Who is this everyone who heard it?  Time to grow up and try acting like an adult instead of a r year old.
"Ida, time for you to face the truth and stop being delusional.  And, instead of responding with insults, put forth an intelligent argument."
Name your mode of removal from office and we will see to it you are removed by that preferred mode. You are going to be removed from office soon for your crimes and missteps and ineptness and lunacy. Otherwise you will grow into a real lunatic tyrant and will ultimately end up like Mussolini or Ceaucescu.
Doin  Great  Donald J. Trump  in  spite  of  words  being  put  in  your  mouth .... These  countries  need  to  improve  from  within .  And  they  need  a  little  help
"Your right we should start recording, BECAUSE WE CANNOT TRUST A THING YOU SAY, LIAR GONNA lie, disgusting , Iâ€™d say you and your administration should be ashamed but you have no shame, _Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ˜¡"
"Democrats, of which I used to be one, are mean girls.  To think all they want for these people from other countries to come in is to feel obligated to register Democrat and vote Democrats in...how sad is that and it should be illegal."
There is no truth and honesty in the media anymore!  They have been so bought and paid for by the democrats and they cannot be trusted.  God Bless you President Trump for standing strong and putting America first!
"Because it makes more sense that a dozen people who heard you say it are lying, rather than a know liar (you) saying something derogatory about brown people, which is very much in your wheelhouse. We're not buying, oh great tangerine nightmare."
"Mr. President, your meetings are not your own.  You obviously have enemies everywhere who will report your every word.  Be careful with what you say.  We love you and pray for you and enjoy watching your success on behalf of this Nation!  Thank you for your service!"
I think taping all meetings would be a very good idea. Or just keep the democrats out of future meetings. I'm so sick of the snowflakes and sick socialist who want this country and our President to fail. God Bless President Trump.
"Mr. President, thank you for your fortitude in the face of adversity! Thank You! Thank You! Thank You! And concerning s---holes..areas described as, ""s----holes"" have nothing to do with skin color, it has to do with how the people of that area treat it (whether it's a nation, state, city, county, or even someone's house. ""s---holes are occupied by people of ALL colors....as a matter of fact, one might even call that place that congress meets at, you know, the United States Capitol, a s----hole......that needs draining. A swamp, if you will ;)"
"Yes, record everything! The President's tweets have done a perfect job at bypassing the MSM's lies. Learn from it and never talk to anyone without audio evidence of what was ACTUALLY said!"
People should be bothered more about what Pelosi said! So insulting to Americans who actually need those crumbs!
Amen . because of her constituents should finally realize that â€œshe isnâ€™t out for them because she would love to tax everyone into oblivionâ€ù _Ÿ‘º_Ÿ’©_Ÿ‘_. Demon rats only care about â€œwhat you can do for themâ€ù!!  Wise up people!!!
Allow me to say it for you POTUS:  Hati is a cess pool of corruption and ignorance at the highest levels and is a sheet hole.  Make no mistake that Mexico and Salvador is only slightly better
"The only thing that makes me question Donald Trump's mental state is, he gave up a opulent wealthy free lifestyle to tie himself down to a imposable job with thankless citizens for a boss."
So you used a derogatory word...oh my like nobody hasn't ever said those kind of words. Geez such snooty self righteous people. You said exactly what some of the other countries are. Let's try to teach them how to better themselves and then maybe they want want to come to our country to better themselves.
"Not while in the position he is in. He should be rising above it... thatâ€™s part of his job description. Heâ€™s supposed to be one of the most powerful people in the world. Instead, heâ€™s a joke. Itâ€™s sad."
"Unfortunately, president Trump is right. It is too often hard to trust people today so maybe his future meetings should be recorded so that people aren't telling lies that can't otherwise be verified to be lies. So sad."
Yes. Record the meetings especially when the demoncraps are lying again. Besides where is that 6 billion hillary stole from the Haitians? They could have  fixed their homes by now.
Everywhere has shitholes including the US. It's caused by the social and economical division. But it is is not how someone on a world stage behaves and I would certainly not want this sorry excuse representing me. He is your representative to the rest of the world and the world's impression of the US and its citizens is increasingly diminishing because of him.
"You've lied under oath in a deposition and were caught in those lies.  You lie every day.  Guess what honey, that makes you a LIAR."
Let's hear his actual words being spoken!! It won't happen because he never said what he was being accused of saying! I agree with President Trump...maybe all of his meetings should be recorded and then the FAKE NEWS about them would end!!
I've been calling many of these 3rd world countries _Ÿ’© holes for quite some time. Because? They are _Ÿ’© _Ÿ’© holes _Ÿ’© _Ÿ’©.
"I shared this on someone elseâ€™s comments this morning. Yes the Bible commands us to pray for our leaders whether we like them or not and I like Donald Trump. Lord I pray that Donald Trump will hear from God, he will get the wisdom of God on things and learn to control his tongue. I also pray that when people start agreeing with him and things do change as we pray for them to do,and turn around he will not get a big head and he will not have pride. He needs to give you the glory when he makes big wins like heâ€™s going to be making as already has. Thank you Lord for this president, keep your hand upon him for good.in jesus name we pray.amen"

"I am willing to go and witness and record every single action and word in any meeting, to prove to the most manipulative gullible press and people that this President is too smart and has been burned too many times and slammed down too many times to give them anymore ammunition! No one owns me! I am more than willing to serve the office of the President!"
"Mumble on.  You don't know or care what rolls out of your mouth until your words cause worldwide offense that appears to tarnish your self image.  It's always about you, not about the harm you create. Your base doesn't care but the rest of us do."
"I would have thought all meeting needed to be recorded for some sort of record. But it would be a good idea to record the meetings. Because even if itâ€™s made up, knowing how youâ€™ve spoken about various things in the past, itâ€™s completely believable. Thatâ€™s the saddest part. If you hadnâ€™t spoken like this in the past it would be more difficult to believe things like this."
No now The Clinton foundation went down there to take care of the problem with all the money they got or did they just put it in her pocket that mightâ€™ve happened !!_Ÿ‘__Ÿ‘__Ÿ‘_
You still dig your grave deeper. .....An  mature child ....and an embrrasement to this nation. ....and I  voted for you! !!!!     Oprah  is lookin better & better. ...or. ..actually anyone else who can project themselves with class as a POTU S.
"President Trump is still on the learning curve when it comes to seeing how little trust he should have in anyone!! Especially Rino Ryan, who is covertly working with Romney to sabotage anything Trump wants to do that does not fill their pocketbooks."
Even the Haitians know there country is bad after that is why they left. Been there beautiful coast lush green just government starving them. Just like other countries ...cruel government
We still know there is no intern under your desk and those fems do too... I'm  shocked you all haven't  laughed yourselves silly with the stupidity that is meted out each day. Maybe you should make a white house duty sort of like jury duty and allow people to  witness first hand daily and report.
"A comment on the tweets, if Trump did like all the other presidents never said anything to the american people to keep them informed. So when Trump tweets something that folks don't like, people would not have anything to complain about. I used to do things for my mother all the time when she was alive, all my other brothers never helped her with anything, my point is the more I did for her the more she complained, so guess what I stopped doing things for her."
"I listened to this committee meeting live on TV.  You never said â€œtake them outâ€ù.  I donâ€™t even remember you calling them s.....hole countries.   It then, I support you and donâ€™t look for such petty things.  Keep going President Trump."
I record every single call that a have with any government agency...I tell everyone that I advocate for yo do the same. It wins a lot if cases when you prove your dealing with liars.
God bless you President Trump! Lies lies and more lies! The American people should NOT trust the media ! Why canâ€™t these people be held accountable for their lies? Yes yes record every word of any meetings you have involving Anyone except your family!
"I would record any meetings with Democrats and the press, they make up so lies and fake news stories.  Don't trust the Democrats, they lie when telling the truth would have served the purpose and they leak  information all the time.  They care more about power than protecting our country."
Yes Mr President Please record them but dont let them know it . I would love to have the recording released at the end of the week . It is sad that this has to be going on . Adults acting like children is SAD . Being triggered by a Word when one is a  Adult is shameful .
"Theres a lot of lands in haiti that have gold diamond in them where no haitians can go, because a sign said american property.america make haiti what it is"
I read the comment he did not say anything about the people themselves but called the counties Shitholes--DID he lie no. A young military friend was down in Haiti about 4yrs ago for some type of disater aid and as quick as food and water supplies were given out the gangs--cilivian and government stole the supplies from the people.
"The Democrats allege that it would be ""inhumane"" and ""not who we are"" to send citizens of these countries back to these countries, now that their temporary residency here is at an end. They would not be saying this if they thought these countries were Shangri-La."
"It is ok. We all know what you meant no matter the term, we are adult more than the childish democrats in the room. I never listen to them anyway, most untrustworthy group of people ON  planet earth."
"Additionally, you really shouldn't even entertain the treasonous rats in ANY discussion unless its in a public forum. Remember, you cannot trust any of them with American interests."
"They can't stand the Presidents successes helping the country and its citizens ! Anything the Dems. Or Fake Media can get on him even comments of truth it's shocking ! Lots coming out about the corruption of the past administration and the set up of President Trump . This is just another try to conceal the truth by them . We are not fooled ! _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸"
"amazing how he says something, has people around him to confirm what he said, now he is backtracking. Like a child, lying to their parents."
"You should have all meetings televised except for those that have classified material in them which require closed door discussions. I'd also  have those meetings sound recorded and filmed for legal purposes. Then have them put away in classified archives. This way no lies can be spread, no classified information can be leaked. If classified information is leaked, spilt or disclosed with the media, you would know who was in those meetings. You can then make an example and fix the problem, you hold them all accountable and fine them all. I do believe when I do my annual classified information training, it says in the law that anyone in possession of or having access to Classified National Security Information who discloses, leaks or spills information regardless of it's classification can and will be fined, imprisoned and have their security clearance revoked. Time to start making examples."
"We would like to hear the full story, although all of us agree that Haiti is a shithole country and always has been."
"I don't know which is worse! Thier feelings being hurt or the millions that was stolen that was meant to help with the devastation that followed a natural catastrophe. You might want to look up the videos from you tube before they get deleted. _Ÿ˜’"
"People within the government on both sides that are not your friends will jump at the chance to use your non-pc words to attack you!  You must learn to protect yourself by choosing your words VERY carefully!!! Fact of ""political life""."
"Part of Trump's campaign was talking about America's need to stop most of the countries ridiculous ""political correctness."" If people get offend that easy, maybe they just need their diaper changed. Trump just tells it like it is. That doesn't mean that if they ran into trouble, he wouldn't be there to help. Give him a break."
"This is the smokescreen for the liberals to SAY they will not work with the DACA trade for the WALL, end to chain migration and visa lotteries, they needed something to make it look like they REALLY care about illegals who they have decided are ""immigrants."" Just more of the same."
"You absolutely should record all future interactions with Democrats and the media. Next time they manufacture false stories you can slam them with the truth. The sad part is even cold hard facts will be ignored and rejected by the ""Resisters"" They truly seem to be living in a different dimension of reality. I pity them."
"Liberals were afraid the democrats had given up to much in their deal with President Trump. As theyAlways do, they come up with a scheme to get out of it and blame it on Trump. I definitely agree ALL meetings should be recorded."
"If the Clinton foundation had given Haiti the money instead of stealing it, they may not be such a craphole"
"They,  should by law be ,required to use the donated money for the need that people gave it for. If we collected money for a  fake need you can be sure everyone would be facing legal challenges led by the  self righteous folks...but Clintonâ€˜s no,no,no."
"So, are you saying you did not call these countries â€œshitholeâ€ù(s)? I voted for you, and have supported you. Do you really think this way about other countries? Hereâ€™s why it matters to me. I respect a man in authority and respect the office of the President of the United States. I also hold to a high standard, a Christian brother...that he do his best to walk in the Spirit of God and not the flesh. It would be difficult to respect a man that bashes others, and continues to do so without repentance. Would love a response, although I probably wonâ€™t receive one, I still pray for you and for the administration."
Those newscasters and democrat sure have tender ears.  65 million of us appreciate you calling it as it is.  That's our President!
It is sad it comes to recording all conversations.  No one should have live that way....not even our President. The scrutiny and harsh criticisms need to end. Can we live in peace with freedom?
Describing something truthfully with less than flowery language may not be politically correct or presidential but it didn't degrade the people it did however describe the environment the people are living in. Whether he said it or not doesn't obscure the truth. Unless you have volunteered in third world countries or the cesspools of poverty in America you can't appreciate the the descriptive language used. There was a comedian who on his return to his home country said every time he started down the plane steps was overwhelmed with the stench of human excrement. Of course he worded it quite vividly. Truthfully.
"Letâ€™s talk about facts here and not made-up-hear-say.  Has everyone so quickly forgotten the MILLIONS of $$$ raised by the corrupt Clinton Foundation that was supposed to go to Haitiâ€”and Haitians never saw even ONE penny of it???  Or what about the Haitian children taken by the Clintons and taken to Lolita Island to be used and abused??!!  If you want to talk about a REAL story on Haiti, start there!!!!  _Ÿ_¬_Ÿ_¬_Ÿ_¬"
"Haitians are truly great people. But their govt has forever been a disaster.  But why are peeps from tragically run countries entitled to come here without merit review? Look to their own island neighbor Dominican Republic, and ask yourself,  why can/does DR control their land border with Haiti? jamaicaobserver.com/News/Dominican-Republic-tightens-border-with-Haiti&template=MobileArticle"
"The left tries and tries to ensnare this guy but heâ€™s far too smart for their feeble childâ€™s play. I think heâ€™s content to let them continue kicking themselves in the dick, and I for one and enjoying the show. More popcorn? Please."
"Good idea to record  every conversation in these times of lying, cheating and fake news. Praying God will shine His light on all the Judas in your mist, with Him nothing is hidden that won't be revealed, hallelujah!"
"You should record everything! Because everything is taking out of context. And every word used, is dismantled from the statements, & comments made by you. Then some false story immediately comes out. EVERYWHERE! IT'S GETTING TIRELESS for your supporters to fight the criminals on your behalf. Especially in this social media realms. Mockingbird media, with hired help from the state's with most gov't contracts, & employees.   They are not happy with your restructuring. And breaking down the corruption that's been holding up our economy. Maybe it's withdrawals.... But, your gonna have to come out week by week, spilling the truth. To the masses via an emergency broadcasting break in to the systems of corruption."
"We had 40 years no immigration.  Shut the border down to all.Shut the government down and fire mostSent Borad of Education to states.Sent as much as you can to statesProtect our countryNo DACA ENOUGH CRIME Law and orderIf we want marihuana change fed law first. Rebablition all.Media sucks"
God bless you Pres. Trump. You spoke the truth...most central american countries are shitholes!  Created by socialist dictatores who obama loved and adored. (Hugo Chavez).  The only people upset are the panzy-candyass liberals who cant stand the truth.
"Mr. President, I think recording all meetings is a fantastic idea. It is unfortunate, but it may be necessary. May God bless, protect and guide you."
"Mr. President, you are the best example as a Representative of We, the People! Non corrupted, non politician, but a real Patriot! Walk Tall and Proud! You are Making America Greater than before! MAGA!!!!"
"Yes, unfortunately ALL meetings from now on need to be recorded if it's not Secret, Top Secret or other military...related.  Cover your keister!   _Ÿ˜_"
"Record it. Unfortunately this is the thanks you get for letting the Press in to witness your bipartisan leadership abilities, something Obama did not possess."
Wait â€œrecord future meetings.â€ù Did you just say what I think you said? Seriously? Iâ€™d be so proud of you if that was a dry joke about Nixon but you also looked directly into the sun during an eclipse _Ÿ˜‚âù_ï¸èâù_ï¸èâù_ï¸èâù_ï¸èâù_ï¸èâù_ï¸è
"No probably about it!!! I'd definitely record them, then they wouldn't have a leg to stand on!!! So tired of all this crap. Been going on from the time you announced your canidacy for president. what a mess"
Apparently the Clintons foundation had no use for them. They kept the millions of dollars collected by them for what was intended to be relief money by donors.
I don't understand what the heck the big deal is. Haiti is a sh**hole. It's just true. Those pathetic libtards just need to learn to deal with reality.
"I don't know if this story is true but it certainly seems to fit with your character.   Where is the personal responsibility for your actions?  Any time there is negative press,  it must be someone else's fault, never yours.  Accept responsibility for actions and words for once."
"If you would have said ""very poor and troubled country"" instead of ""shitholes"", then we wouldn't be talking about this. Develop some tact."
Well Josh..run for office
Actions speak louder tham words Dear Mr President. Keep up the good work and maybe yoir letting them in to close. Perhaps their not entitled to what your thinking tweet not your thoughts but your accomplishments...
"Mr President, your comments were cringe-worthy, and I think you owe everyone an apology, especially to Haitians but also to the American people and those who voted for you. No reason to use that type of language or have that type of attitude. Positive spins do not cover up your immature rudeness."
BS.
"I have supported you from the beginning and will continue to do so.  People seem content with politicians who habitually lie to them, but you get one man brave enough to dare tell the truth and a hell breaks loose.  Keep up the good work!"
"You not only said the atrocity you said, but also want to lie about it. You are a compulsive liar and should be ashamed of it. You forgot there were witnesses on that meeting? Sad. Very Sad."
"AYISYEN ras mwen yo ak tout lÃ_t zanmi toupatou sou fas tÃ¨ a, mesye a di li pat di sa ,ann fÃ¨ lapÃ¨ paske le mond se pou tout moun .P. Trump siw di sa Bondye ap baw repons, HaÃ¯ti ka pa devlope ase men se yon gwo peyi ki fÃ¨ anpil lÃ_t peyi konnen lâ€™endepans yo."
"As a Marine in 1950 went to many island many Country some we help many times with money like millions, food a place to sleep better than we had ,and yet those people hated us for not doing more,that money never got to the poor people. worked hard just to bring clean water,their own people we heard was selling it ,we no work one told me U.S. will take us in we no get money,we go to America but cost money,we don`t hate you while you here we hate you when you leave"",nothing has change in 68 years""sound the same."
"Todo crÃ_tico, que muda o sentido da palavra dos outros sÃ£o peÃ§onhentos. Como vivem no arrastro dos seus corpos, sÃ_ sabem dar botes. E, no entanto, ha muitos humanos que sÃ_ vivem desse expediente. NÃ£o possuindo qualidades para serem eretos, sÃ_ vivem no arrastro, aguardando oportunidades para destilar seus venenos. ParabÃ©ns President Donald J. Trump. Continue no caminho ereto para afastar esses peÃ§onhentos."
"1 John 3:17â€“1817 But xwhoever has this worldâ€™s goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart from him, how does the love of God abide in him?18 My little children, ylet us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth."
"It's so easy to sit behind your keyboard and pass judgment. How many of you are willing to take these people into your own homes at your own personal expense, for an indefinite period of time? List your names below.. The Trump administration can maybe help by hooking you up with one, two or more Hatians.. Anyone? Anyone?"
"Dems know that they just have to make accusations against you and the liberal media will do the rest. Perhaps you should document everything. Not that that will make much difference,because you won't see the media report anything that would favor you."
The physical condition of Haiti is a mess due to the hurricane and lack of an economy to recover.  Trump did NOT nigate Haiti.  He stated a fact.
"what amazes me is those who keep getting offended, have you all not figured out that this is Trump. This is why his supporters voted for him.  HE IS NOT A POLITICIAN with polished pretty words.  He speaks without having to worry what lies he has told, unlike that former guy, or Killary for that matter."
"Sadly, Trump is mostly correct, just used a term that pissed people off. These countries are down trodden counties. With most of them, the only really nice part is the resort areas that are typically created by America or other outside countries. Pretty much, he is wondering how to make America an even better country so that people from other 1st world countries would want to live here. Everything is directed to the poor to come here, so why not make this a place everyone would be envious to live in."
"Unfortunately recordings do need to be done.  When the media, Hollywood and others twist what was actually said publish the recording.  This should be enough of an embarrassment for them that they stop.  Sad it has come to this."
"President Trump, just have a recorder without them knowing it , and ask your republicans to say something  about this allegation, coz every time you say something itâ€™s been sensitive to the media. Another thing, ask all republicans to with you in your side or nothing at all."
"My husband was in military for 20 years. He called them ""3rd world toilets"". There are countries that use human feces for fertiliser. Pile it up in great mounds. Some countries use the side of the road and fields for toilets.  What is wrong with the truth?"
"Your doing wonderful . Keep up the good work and make America great again . They talk about  all the wrong things and not the good you do . And your amazing . And they say you don't know the words of the song . But guess what you do amazing job when your doing your speech . I can't believe you know all thosePlaces  and country s . I can't believe how wonderful you are . You make other people who speck look bad . Keep up the good work .   I know many people love you also . Proud ofYou ."
I don't care about the DADC at all we need to worry about our  citizens and our military first.  I don't care about illegal immigrants they have no rights. I have a friend who got her green card so she now has rights. Stop trying to take care of everyone else and start talking care of the people who are citizen's. Get the budget done that will help citizens not children of illegals they are not our priority.
Obama can call those countries a Sâ€”-show and its okay? President Trump says Sâ€”-hole and itâ€™s not okay. Arenâ€™t they both the same thing? Keep doing what you do Mr. President! You got my vote.....Again.
"I pray for you, Mr. PRESIDENT, as many do.  We stand behind and beside you.  The devil has such a short time he is striking has hard as he can.  Know you are loved and placed here by God himself. Thank you for being obedient to God."
"Record every meeting from now on.  They come up with ridiculous statements, tweet out what was actually said. After that send them some sort of sauce to go with the crow they will be eating."
Its amazing how liberals twist things around.Maybe the president was referring the governments of these country as the shithole and how they treat their citizens.I find it unlikely he was judging the people but the governments that represent them. They do live in poorer conditions than people who live in the states!
"there are productive good citizens in every country, unfortunately the US immigrant population of late doesn't reveal this. come one come all is not our best practice.  Start putting USA first!"
"Yes Mr. President.  You should record/televise all meetings because the Democrats can't be trusted to tell the truth... they have been lying for so long, they just don't know how to stop.  It would also expose them for what they really believe, and not what they want their voters to believe."
At this point if I were you I would record everything from the time my eyes open in the morning including bathroom break snaps and snacks and everything! God knows what they're going to start whining about next!
Right
"Blame the Clintons and the Dems all they are about is filling there pockets at the cost of the poor they say they are for the poor and middle class what a pile of horse crap, they use and destroy, God Bless President Trump, drain the swamp, while you stand alone against the evil! your not alone sir please keep the fight going for America and God Bless our troops and police and first responders, we love you and are proud of you and our beautiful First Lady."
It would be smart to record all your meetings. It is obvious the dems will do  and say ANYTHING to discredit you. You should know this. What concerns me is the lack of support from the Republicans. Haven't heard one of them dispute this.
"Donald J. Trump, EXACTLY!  Don't make a deal with DACA...that's a deal with the devil for conservatives.  They want DACA so they have more voters. These so called dreamers will never vote anything but the democratic ticket. Keep your word!"
"Why is everyone so offended? With all the aid they were sent recently, Haiti should be the diamond of the Caribbean."
"I truly believe that the world is divided into 2 categories 1. All of us supporters of Trump 2. People that donâ€™t like Trump I believe that this is true , when I see someone I ask if he /she supports Trump if the answer is yes then I know we will get along nicely !"
"Frankly I am not entirely sure why people are making such a huge deal about Haiti, to begin with. They are not a strong U.S. ally, they have little to nothing to offer, and are pretty much only semi-redeemed by their strategic closeness to Cuba....then again...we are almost equally as close to Cuba, geographically speaking. Let them deal with their own problems. It isn't a federal matter. If there are folks here who are sympathetic to the suffering of the Haitians...well, that is what charitable giving exists for. Sponsor Haitian families through impact gifts, or better yet, let these families into your home and sponsor a tenure here in every way while they seek out a path to citizenship. Seems simple to me. In terms of the comments that may or may not have been made. I tend to lean more toward them not being made, but if they were....are we no longer allowed to call a stone, a stone, a car, a car, the sky, blue?"
"Why does Mr Trump keep referring to Mr Obama, blaming him for whatever when he is no longer President? concentrate on the now not the past, fix policies and budgets and get some good connections with other countries"
"You definitely should record future meetings! Then pay attention to this.Bible Study:James 1:26""Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues deceive themselves, and their religion is worthless.""James 3:2-12""We all stumble in many ways. Anyone who is never at fault in what they say is perfect, able to keep their whole body in check.When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal. Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go. Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark. The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course of oneâ€™s life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and sea creatures are being tamed and have been tamed by mankind, but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse human beings, who have been made in Godâ€™s likeness. Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers and sisters, this should not be. Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring? My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.""Brother Trump, you are making needless enemies by not being careful how you speak. And remember this:Ephesians 4:29""Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, so that it will give grace to those who hear."""
Let's continue on the really important issues like the pizzagate/pedogate case. It is our responsibility under God to take care of  to protect the children his children. This is all I care about. And to the President this is horrific! It's human trafficking!!!!
The global elites r not interested in working with u.  The DACA permits run out on March 6th.  Let them run out & just build the wall with all the money u haved saved this nation.  There goal is 2 destroy this nation & they will not stop at that.  No more olive branches 2 treasonous traitors.
Freedom of speech is gone. Freedom of thought too. It's a sad day for America. They are angry that we elected an honest man as president. Praying for you Sir.
the only hatians come here to deal drugs they are violent but demcraps want them and the money they can give them they buy democrap votes. ask schummer how much money he gets from these people it sure isnt grandma and grandpa. its blood money schummer gets for protecting them and de blasio check people around them. they take money for illegals.
"Just ADMIT you said shithole countries. You know you said it. Others in the room heard you say it. Going forward, maybe every.single thought in your head shouldnâ€™t come out of your mouth. I was taught that if you donâ€™t have something nice to say donâ€™t say anything at all."
"You're not just a liar, you lie daily. It's your hobby. Why would we believe you over *everyone* else in the meeting. You repeatedly deprecated them. Go back to your shithole bankrupt hotels and stop destabilizing our country and the world."
The pathology of your lying is reaching apocalyptic proportions. I could listen to statements made by you and Durbin for the next ten years and would believe Durbin over you each and every time.
"I understood it. Why did the Dems  turn it into the people. They must have a one track mind.  All of a sudden they became saints with virgin ears. I've heard slips of some very nasty language and nothing but a chuckle happened.  But with anyone around be careful, they want to call you on it.  Hmmm it is a s***hole _Ÿ˜„"
"People from dysfunctional countries whether they be in Africa, Asia the Americas or anywhere else in the world need to stay home and WORK to fix their own problems instead of coming here and enjoy what Americans have worked to build.  We need English speaking people who have skills and who can support themselves immediately on arrival."
"was there a audio of his comments? washington post the same people who said Hillary was wimming in the elections. Also check out the vulgar mouth  LBJ had!  just plain ole street talk folks, no more ""smiley faces & flowery words"" this is Trump."
"you were CORRECT in your vulgur tweet ( s&^%hole country) because it is, YOU DIDN'T SAY Haitians are, just their country!! but truly, we don't need to swear do we?? there ar eother appropriate words for these things"
Record all meetings .Recorded sessions will only prove what was actually said not some ones version of what was said .Some one needs to take a history lesson we have had many Presidents in the White house that have used langage that was not nice to hear .Anderew Jackson /  Truman / Richage Nixon ever listen to the water Gate tapes .
"My greatest wish is that everyone would just settle down, take a breath and chill. All the babble from both sides is really becoming very tiresome, that is all."
"Yes Mr. President, have your meetings in the open before the American people, not behind close doors because they will lie about everything you say. Haters & Dividers. Democrats are NOT for your agenda & Never will be. Open door meetings us good to do with cameras tapeing"
"You are a disturbing individual.Purely and simply disturbing and extremely ignorant and devoid of humanity and any moral compass.Unfortunately before you and your family are finished many will suffer. Perhaps even die."
"I believe you, Mr. President.  God Bless you in all you have to go through to get done what needs to be done.  My husband and I pray for you, Melania, and all your family every day."
"They are so pathetic they will go to all means to make you look bad, but really they could not look more dreadful, no matter what you do they will twist it. And they talk about lies, they cannot even tell the truth, they are pure evil these silly silly lefties.."
Even if it was said i gaurantee it wasnt the worst thing said in a closed door meeting. The difference is that most people know that if a harsh comment is said that going to the media about it will only hurt not help.
"Not the first time they do this. Keep up the good,work, we have your back. Just get that wall up, drugs are killing our children And get rid if chain migration. The dreamers, let only the hard working stay, criminals and welfare recipients should go."
Perhaps if the Clinton Foundation had sent the $$$ they promised Haiti it wouldn't be such a terrible place!
"If those countries were not shitholes, they would not have their hand out asking for financial aid from the USA."
You say whatever you want Mr. President. I just love seeing the snowflakes quiver and shake at every oratory statement you may or not have made. Whatever pot you stir up always later becomes obvious it needed discussion. Look forward to seven more years!
Maybe people should ask the Clintons where those billions of dollars went to that were supposed to rebuild Haiti
Well nothing else is working so they have to think up another strategy to try and boot you out of office! Imagine what we'd be called if we did all this that the left are doing to Trump!!
"We don't *trust* you because you constantly *LIE* to us.Like you're cancelling your trip to the UK because Obama sold the embassy?1) You planned your trip AFTER the embassy was sold/being rebuilt.2) It was sold by bush."
"Since Trump announced he was running for president, the left has done nothing  but make up fake news, fake narratives, fake accusations..so whatâ€™s stopping them from reporting fake statements."
"Don't worry about it! We all know what you meant! And its true! Americans should come before Illegals! When all of our Vets and children and the elderly are off the streets and being cared for, is when we can take care of non citizens!"
"Attention:Bay Pines VA Director Klinker,Take a moment Miss Klinker and review the photos on this post and you will see examples of why you and your facility are under such scrutiny. As you are quite well aware, the things mentioned on the posters are only the tip of the iceberg of wrongdoing and problems at Bay Pines, but don't you worry we are working on exposing every bit of it. You had opportunity after opportunity to make things right. One whistleblower came to you about unnecessary surgeries and told you he was worried about retaliation from his service, you assured him that you wouldn't allow that to happen, 2 Days Later he was walking his resignation paperwork through because the retaliation and harassment had started all over again and when your assistant Debbie Bailey told you that employee was walking his paperwork through because of the harassment he had predicted your comment was "" well I hate to lose a good employee"" but you did absolutely nothing to protect that employee you didn't call him you didn't look into it you just ignored it. well the days of you being able to ignore the problems that Fester under your lack of leadership have come to an end. You are on notice that you are under scrutiny and yes there are good employees at Bay Pines that are appalled by some of the things that they see. Bay Pines long history of retaliation and harassment and intimidation of whistleblowers has worked fairly well for you till now, but there are many at Bay Pines that are coming forward with tips leads and information that is going to be exposed no matter how hard or how ridiculous the attempts to silence whistleblowers is. it is my hope that you are removed from federal service and never allowed near another veteran. SincerelyBay Pines Exposed"
"I do wish our President would temper his remarks, and realize that as we all have the freedom to use colorful language at times, he needs to  be more cautious about what he says....especially in the company of those who do not want to see his administration succeed. we all most look inside ourselves to hold our tongues at times...even if we feel the exact same way."
"Well, it is a shithole _Ÿ_·_Ÿè»â€çâ™€ï¸è but, of course no one wants to mention our governmentâ€™s (and othersâ€™) role in said shittiness...Dems do the same thing here but their followers donâ€™t want to admit it..."
It's odd that durbin and graham heard this how in the world do you deal with these idiots yes you need to tape your meetings but don't tell them we know these guys but they will try anything to try and destroy you so we love ya and proud of you STAND UP. You're the best
Serious money is owed to these people that was abscounded with by U know Who! There is enough money to build hospitals housing jobs and get these poor people out if the mud  with tiny houses.
"Mr. your about are all time virulent and you forget that you are the President of the United States of America and it is out question a President normal can keep these about such. then this said that the world you look carefully, you are came to find US and you will leave we let because you are on points removal."
You try to be partisan and this is what happens.  The Democrats are disgusting individuals.  They still keep trying to pull the race card.  They will use every opportunity to get close to you to fabricate something snd there friends at MSM will run with anything they say.
Did he really make that statement and is there actual proof.Did somebody take something out of context and leek it to the left media and they in turn twist it around to trash the president? just asking.
"This is a repost from an actual citizen of London Mr. DaddsFirst of all delighted he has cancelled. But actually quite disappointed. It has deprive me for the first time in my 60 years to go on a demonstration. He also lied. The Obama administration did not sell the old Embassy as it was not thereâ€™s to sell. The US only leased the building and  site from the Duke Of Westminster who owns the freehold. The building was old and not suitable for the 21st century. It was far more economically viable to build a state of the art modern building suitable for the age we now live in. Also for the first time the US have a freehold site which is now fully American Territory. Not just rented from another person. One would have thought that Trump, the business genius and property tycoon would have fully understood about leasehold property and how it works. But one forgets he just walks away from leases, goes bankrupt, leaves vast debts behind him and has no sleepless nights about others he has left in dire financial distress due to his actions. One questions his ability to do or understand the simple workings of the property market.Or anything else for that matter.Oh and Bush authorised all and the building of the new embassy before Obama was even elected."
"The one question that should always be asked before granting anyone US citizenship: ""Is this individual an asset or a liability to the United States; is granting this individual citizenship in the best interest of the United States?"""
"They are indeed shitholes. Living in a metal tent with dirt floors after billions of dollars given to the corrupt government. They want to leave to come here and escape that, say it with me, SHITHOLE"
"There are always going to be the haters and those who's world you turned upside down by being elected and putting a halt to their corrupt gravy train at the expense of good hard working tax payers. Of course they'll say and write negative crap about you and your administration. Millions of US know this to be so. Keep identifying them and casting them aside and moving forward. After just one year in office and you are making a great difference, I can hardly wait to see what becomes of the next three!!!! Totally off the wall!!!! God bless you and yours!"
"It's far more productive and a better result to assist and insist that the Haitian government become a proper democratic government free from corruption ( as much as possible ), prevention is better than cure. A better country = less of a need to emigrate to the U.S."
"Unfortunately, people want to believe everything the media reports as true...they are out to destroy him one lie at a time. Consider the source, people. Did YOU hear him say that? Thatâ€™s what I thought."
Ask Greta and Samaritans Purse what Haiti looks like.  They were just there helping those poor people.
"I would have thought he would have learned by now to record everything or better yet put all meetings on tv, the public should be privy to these meetings any way. Itâ€™s our money"
"Apparently most of us have no problem understanding what you say. The press, Democrats and those who have been brainwashed and need the press to interpret for them just don't get it."
"Julia, you simply excuse everything he says and does.  As he says, he could shoot someone in public and his followers would immediate justify it."
"The foundation was founded to help people ?? Where is the best place to start?? AT home where else ?? Help your self, help your wife, and help your child. only  the honorable thing to do. it's been said god help those that help them self. And there god is money.??"
Yes you need back up for sure. Mr. President. Looks like you would tire of misquoted. I am tired of all that crap. Keep focused on the important stuff. You republicans better shore up your platform. Just saying
"We, The Base, know what you meant.  Sometimes, I wish you would lighten up just a tad on the language but, ultimately, I am looking for ACTION!!!!   As long as you Bring It,  The Wall, better border security, better immigration process, better economy, I will be in your corner."
"Haiti is a shithole.. After the 2010 earthquake, the Clintons gave all the rebuilding contracts to their buddies and robbed the Hatians of the rest."
"Sr Presidente Trump essa midia vagabunda e mentirosa quer te derrubar,mas sabemos muito bem disso,sabemos da sua indole e seu compromisso com seu povo...Deus te abenÃ§oe ...seguimos aqui a distancia aa repercussÃµes via Internet porque nossa televisao aqui no Brasil tambem e um lixo comunista....Se possÃ_vel nos ajude aqui tambem Sr.IntervenÃ§Ã£o Militar ...Go Trump."
"The press said you made a derogatory statement about Africa too. Since, you said you have been reported out of context please continue the good work. You have earned my respect the day you won that election in the United States even with the whole world against you.Mr President,your administration is the manifestation of God's support because he alone enthrones and dethrones."
Good morning mr. President Donald Trump. I think Haiti needs to sue the Clinton foundation for all the funds they took.
"It is amazing to me, people open their eyes, but do not acknowledge what they see right in front of them. I am not sure if they don't see or don't want to acknowledge what they do see. Donald Trump...against All odds is doing things in this country that other presidents wish they could have done, but never did. He is a remarkable businessman and President.The stock market was supposed to crash when he was elected...instead the stock market is setting historical records.Do you people really believe this is by chance. I dont and no one will ever convince me otherwise. The politicians are running scared on both sides republicans and democrats...but the democrats are viscious at every turn and Donald Trump is steadfast in his convictions to honor the promises he made and this has not been accomplished by past people holding our highest office.This man under the scrutiny and traps laid for him at every turn, he comes out smelling like a rose.He has no agenda for himself or his personal gains. He dosent need it, he already has it.This is why the media, the politicians and the liberal junkies are cringing in their shoes.They cannot stand a man of conviction doing what is best for Our nation and not for himself and others who would benefit from the high office as has been done in the past. I am so proud to say he is my President and the leader of our nation. He is as stedfast in his convictions for our country as he is to the people of our nation who elected him. Pray for President Trump daily and help to make sure he and our other leaders have that same conviction and dedication to do what is needed to be done to Make America Great Again as he promised. Keep up the Great work Mr. President!!! God Bless Donald Trump and God Bless This United States of America!!!"
"This guy is either suffering from dementia,  a pathological liar or thinks people don't listen to his words.i believe it's all the above"
Mr President always remember you're a World leader respect all countries  speak the Word that will bring love dont hate anybody  always mind your speech word is powerful may God help you.
Some of these countries and parts of America are shitholes like Indian Country and they are because of corrupt government officials. It doesn't matter with what Our President says it turned into words said and not on why are they shitholes and how is does it become our problem. Like Mexico free trade has always been free drug trade.
When you mock other Nation's daily it makes very hard young American who are trying to competing Chinese busnisess  in Africa and else where full of natural resource .. No country you leave it every Nation's you Insult is looking to do busnisess somewhere else ...
My God.  People canâ€™t even discuss the subject without calling each other names.  You people in this country become pathetic and an embarrassment.  Other countries are laughing at you
"The laughing matter is one's inability to call things as they are, in the name of being politically correct.  You judge from safety and comfort.  Have you ever been to a 3rd world country?  And if so, have you ever said to yourself ""I'd love to live here!""?  I've been, and although it's no laughing matter in which people live, in fact, it's downright horrifying; ignoring the conditions and thinking they are anything other than shitholes, would be hypocritical.  The people are often wonderful in spirit and heart, but you are attempting to conflate the two. The joke is ultimately on countries who are run and exploited by PC culture.  They are in rampant societal decline.  Each group segregating into even smaller subgroups which point fingers in the name of being offended with one another."
Don't worry. Sane people know that there are many countries that are exactly what you (ostensibly) said they are.
Record everything.  You are surrounded by people who put self interest before the country.  Drain the swamp
"The Democrats are threating to close the government and lay off federal workers, as well as threaten the nations safety by not raising funding for our military.  Why?  To protect illegal DACA aliens.  They will screw the US for foreign illegal aliens.  They will pay in November."
"Good Morning, Mr. President!!! Never trust a Traitor & all who are doing everything they can to undermine your administration are just that!!!! They need to be held accountable!!!! And Yes by all means record every meeting!!!"
You people are pathetic ! There's no other way to describe you!! You're misinformed and weak minded . It's the only way to describe your diluted devotion to this con man. You all need prayer!
"The Democrats wouldn't take exception to those countries being called shitholes if it wasn't for the fact that Democrat controlled cities like Detroit, Chicago, and Baltimore and those countries look a lot alike."
When are you going to hold him accountable for going golfing again this weekend. 46 million and counting in his pocket. That's why he won't show his tax returns. .most of workers there are minimum wage and some immigrants.
"Those particular Countries are in a bad way at the moment, it would be quite natural for anyone, who has taken the time or shown any interest in these Countries, to see that, it's not a secret!! I can quite understand Donald Trumps ""haters lol"" using the opportunity, to deliberately ""twist"" his words.Very petty and Class room behaviour._Ÿ‘è_Ÿè__Ÿ‘è_Ÿè__Ÿ‘è_Ÿè__Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚"
The Left/Democrats/Trump Haters (especially the reporters) just want to cause problems and spread hate!!!! I don't even waste my precious moments on this Earth reading or listening to their negative BS!!
"A s###hole country is just that,  if Hilary Clinton had one USA would shorely have become a s***hole also."
"Notice celebs said they would move to Canada?They never said they'd move to Haiti or Africa. Wonder why that is."
Am disappointed to hear this . We have to show respect for people. No matter what. 3rd world countries don't have the luxuries that are so plentiful here in the United States. . It is not necessary to use foul language any way. Mr. President you should probably clean up you mouth a bit.
"seriously??? who is a 'shithole' country? what about this nation with all its wealth and millions of homeless people, including women and children? ghettos and shelters and slums ... and all the money in the world."
"I get so tired of our president having to defend himself at every turn. Every word he says somehow gets turned around to make him look bad.  I admit he could clean up his language a bit but my goodness, he's saying what half the population is thinking."
"I just dont understand why you care? All this crap is internet only.. if the internet was taken away, none of these people would have anything to complain about or anything negative to say about you... its all just bogus online crap.. So why keep buying into it? Why feel the need to prove stuff to a bogus online only community?  We all know you cant believe anything you see online or in the news... hell, we've heard that since we were kids.. just seems everyone has forgotten that and just buys into everything they see."
"They will look for any reason to criticize what you have to say. They will lie, fabricate , pick apart every word you speak. It's sick and exhausting I'm sure."
"If Haiti and the rest of the third world was not a shithole, then they would not want to leave it so desperately."
That country is trashed right now. Needs helps. People are still living in tents. They received billions from around the world yet see little progress. Someone is getting rich off this.
"Exactly ,!!  Record future meetings!! I know it sucks to be falsely accused and your words twisted by jackasses with an evil agenda!!  They are all drunk on destruction!!! Dum dems"
"Sir, just be careful in what you say or do, the liberals and the demorats are just there to pounce at whatever they can, just  to degrade you and try calling for your impeachment! We're with you in prayer and spirit!"
"Ya you never would lol... real problem I have with you is you lack the testicular fortitude (or maybe just the testicles) to actually own up to the stream of fecal matter that never stops coming out of your fat mouth, which luckily is still situated firmly between you buttocks. Trust is a two way street bozo"
"Next time think before you speak!Or just keep your mouth close!Everyday you messing up this country worldwide!Inappropriate language or bad words are not for a president period!_Ÿ–•_Ÿè__Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ‘__Ÿè__ŸŒ__Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸"
Just so you know we believe you we know CNN and all those other news media love the twist the truth and turn it into lies One day they will have to pay for what they are doing keep up the good work Mr. President
"We still love you, Mr. President.  But we don't need ""comprehensive"" immigration reform.  No amnesty.  We need to go after the ones who are using illegals as slave labor.  _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸â™¥ï¸è             NO amnesty!"
"The Dems / Swamp tactic is to lie, sow division and cause chaos - I see it in our previously close and loving family, and what they are doing is a treasonous, despicable and shameful CRIME which they must be held accountable for."
"I believe all people should have a chance for immigration!  But the President should be able to speak his mind in a private meeting!!  If people disagree they should tell him so , not be like children and tattletell on him!"
"ABC News ans others need to find something to whine about. Except for giving the local weather they are almost worthless. Thank you Mr. President for doing your job while the Democrats snooze away, drawing their pay, obstructing progress at ever point, and the fake news supports them. We, are with you Mr. President."
"truth is bitter boss.people are been killed in Benue state Nigeria and residents are running to USA for protection. If you don't call leaders out on corruption, injustice, genocide and herdsmen attack, then who will."
"Today one of the largest military that has risen to count Nicolas Maduro's Dictatorship has fallen. The last cry for help from the Venezuelan people fell silent.Go in peace warrior! Oscar PÃ©rez!Free Venezuela, Donald Trump, please!"
President please stop explaining yourself I love that you have no filter and speak your mind it makes you more transparent and I love that.  I agree that these countries must be shitholes otherwise why are people dying to get out of them.  If they werenâ€™t wouldnâ€™t people rather stay in their own countries. You spoke your mind you spoke the truth let the left do what they do pick every work you say apart and try to prosecute you for it.  No one that matters is listening to them anymore anyways.
"Ha ha, are you fourteen?"
Hahaha are you a liberal?
"Fear not for I trust in you borrowed from the coins and paper money that we still use in circulation today e pluribus unum kemosabe.  I could have spelled this manually faster if Google didn't interfere. â™§"
Just go live on Facebook for every meeting with anyone political. Make it all open to the public. True transparency so long as it doesnâ€™t put anyoneâ€™s life in danger let us see what goes on behind the closed doors. Maybe some of them would actually start working for the people and not themselves
Donâ€™t justify yourself President Trump. You could literally say you love any and all immigrants and they would still bash you. Some people like to hear sugarcoated things and take offense when you call things as they are. _Ÿ‘ç_Ÿè»_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
Y tambien dicen los medios que insulto a el salvador y si lo hiso a sus gobernantes esta muy bien por que son unos corruptos pero el pueblo no tenemos la culpa de como estas personas llamados padres de la patria nos tengan asi.

"Never? People donâ€™t believe you because unlike you they have memories. You said it, then you lied about it. Record all of your meetings and release them all, barring national security issues. You work for us."
Shoot a friend of mine went to Niagara Falls a few weeks ago and was almost not allowed in Canadian side for a DUI conviction...Got in..but that is the vetting done there.
"Even European nations had moments, more than moments, where they were horrid places to live. That is why some of my ancestors came here, mostly penniless, and embraced freedom and prosperity. Nothing new."
Si como no...ni el se cree esa gran farsa ...Racista !!!!!!! Y su paÃ_s no seria lo q es si no le hubieran choleriado tantos latinos durante aÃ±os ....pero la reprimenda d Dios caerÃ¡ sobre el xq es justo y gente altanera como el q se cree Dios ...la paga q recibirÃ¡ d lo alto sera la q se merece
"I didn't think so Mr. President! Fake news strikes again. Maybe you should record your meetings, or let them be broadcast live like you did on Wednesday."
"Then  meet with  Haitian community. Also, your show was  televised the other day, and in the transcript they left out key parts where you  agreed with Diane. Wonder  why???"
So what?  It would be interesting to be a mouse in the corner at some of the meetings these people who think this is so terrible participant in.  They are really getting desperate if this is all they have to complain about.
YES YOU DID.  TOO MANY WITNESSES.  If you have such a great relationship why are you evicting Haitians.  Yes!  Record meetings.  Your stupidity will be further exposed to the world.
"Face it Trumpateers, you voted in and still support this sh#$hole  president despite his deceits. There is not a shovel big enough to clean up the diaherrea spewing from his mouth, nor  the stank he will be leaving  behind from his dictatorial reign, that is, if he even makes it 3yrs. What a true disgrace to this Great Country of ours, and that folks is Not fake news, just saying!"
"I'm not so happy course of media ,most us now its time to glow up and focus on development and get over about election.But Africa it's not our culture to be ignorance about that unated states,"
"Ask anyone if they could only pick one country to live in...Haiti, Africa or Norway, which would they choose?"
"I knew what you meant Mr. President Trump. The dem's with their fingers in their ears, saying la,la,la,la, and worse putting words in your mouth twisting what you say. Some things never change. Help us help u. How to turn this around, the deep state?"
"Who really cares! Big deal if he said it or not. I surely wouldn't trust anything the media, democrats, or liberals say or care what they think. It's the same thing over and over again. They always playing the race card. I never seen democrats cry so much since they lost the election. I wake up smiling every morning. Loving life."
Dont worry Sir we know the truth.  God Bless you. Be strengthened for your two terms. No weapon formed against you will prosper and every tongue that rises up against you in judgement we condemn. Xx
"Of course, the word of Sen. Dubious Durbin (D-IL). Very dubious, indeed. Ask yourself: ""have the Democrats ever lied to you""? Or better yet"" ""when was the last time they told you the truth?"" That long a go?"
I am 100% behind you Mr. President.  I think it's beyond pathetic what the media and the democrats are doing.  They're acting like children.  Too bad they can't be taken behind the woodshed and made to pick out their own switch!!
"So he said Haiti is a ""shithole""...so what! It is...how do I know? I spent 6 months of my life there."
Peter Heck get over it. Gosh we had a Governor call our side of our state the shithouse side. It must be political talk. Maybe he is finally speaking what the rest of the politicians say.
"The truth will always rise up, we all know who stole the money from Haiti's earthquake relief. Lets prosecute."
"Dear Mr. President Trump. Please be awere of whoever pople/person is/are with you 24/7!Of course, with few exceptions that you know.The DEMs have one and only mission; bring you down!  So please be vigilant and record/cameras accros the board."
"The governments of most of the poor underdeveloped countries with the help of some of their rich citizens have systematically corrupted these Countries. No concern about the deplorable conditions the citizens have to live in.This has gone on for so long it has become accepted and considered normal, just the way things are. We continue to send money, and other aid, and all it does is enrich the pockets of the rich and powerful. The cycle just continues. There is no word strong enough to describe how deplorable these few people are and how deplorable they keep the country. Not the average poor citizenry, with very little way to improve the Country. Stop dissecting every single word, and look at the whole context of the statement. I have to admit the President uses very poor judgment in the words he uses some time. It is sad, but he must realize every single word  he uses is subject to being dissected and used out of his meaning."
"""According to a source""  funny how all these terrible things are so vaguely credited to anonymous sources..."
"The white house is full of preschoolers. Don't,stop it,he touched me,mmm you just said S HOlE word!!! If we whan t to see and hear this we can go to a daycare and we don't have to pay $$$$$$ to each kid! It's time to grow up and get to work and stop playing the blame game and earn what you get paid for and fix what's broke!!!!"
"you should find these people that like to leak info and try to undermine you and get rid of them!! Drain the swamp! Just like anyone's employment, you become an issue in part of the company, spreading lies, rumors, undermining the owners or people in charge, you get FIRED!"
"Mr President, the last thing we need is meetings being recorded and people being able to listen to every disturbing thing you say.  While I agree TPS duration for people from shithole countries should have time limits, you produce enough drama without meetings being recorded."
"Trump is right. From now on record everything.and be a little more careful what you say, because like the law says. When Democrats are around everything you say can and will be used against you."
"Mr. President, Those places are shitholes. You spoke the truth. and State department: 5 states in Mexico travel warning. Wouldn't get caught dead there!"
"Why not ""find"" the billions of dollars in funding missing that NEVER made it to Haiti, AND REBUILD IT!"
"what now  no trust i will send letter  now, i  trust you, you  are drunk  ok i trust donnie how i can , you know my  life.  i will not send fastesst way, too expensive donnie, ordinary way but registertered, must come. 16 to maximum 20 days. that is also good."
"Was this meeting recorded? And is there concrete evidence he said, these countries are shitholes. Or is this hearsay? Haven't heard on the news, who the person(s) who can confirm this.. just wondering."
"The snow flake loser Democrats will turn everything Trump says around and try to discredit the President, the snow flakes are the losers with no ambition and zero morals"
"What chaps me more is that the Dems/liberal socialists & fake media take issue with all the truely GREAT things that Trump has done & is doing for America.  Clearly something they fail to understand merely because they lost the White House, Congress & the Judicial branches of government.  After all, I am quite certain that EVERY PRESIDENT since Washington has undoubtedly employed colorful derogatory language to describe other countries, entities, persons in the past and likely will in the future."
"It is just sad that the democrats have to stoop so low and lie about our President.  We moved on from obummer, now it's time for everyone to get on board with the President. He is really making changes and making America strong again"
"No recordings please. It doesn't work well for republicans, IE:Nixon although democrats get away with unmasking and campaign surveillance just fine.  Always the double standard."
Sometimes I feel that all political activity should be on record or recorded for since the citizens can be with no reason why not public servants for the public can actually know what they're planning
do record meetings and remember that your twitter is not representing the american people.. it makes you sound like a teenager.As president you are supposed to represent all americans..democrats included..Hoped this next four years would have been a new beginning for our country...This last year has been very frustrating for those who have voted for  you to change things around..not happening..Please think it through before you twitter things and be a President that we can be proud of..
"If you said what they are saying itâ€™s sad they have to go run and tell News media knowing there is so much work to be done, now you have to deal with the news media.He could have came to you and discussed it."
Definitely record all future meetings.  These democrats are vicious liars.  Make sure you have plenty of bodyguards around you at all times.  Please keep fighting for right! We support you.
Loving the Trump family and pray for you all. Dear Lord in Heaven please protect the Trumps. Please Lord give Donald J Trump the wisdom and insight he needs in to be able to handle every thing thrown at him. In Jesus Holy Name Amen
"I cannot believe the hater's are making a huge deal about s--t.  Seriously?  I'm sure everyone, has said, s-it & worse, at times. I know I have. POTUS DJT is the best ever. GOD bless DJT, GOD bless USA._Ÿ’œ_Ÿ’œ_Ÿ’œ. Amen."
"Keep going Donald. Economy, unemployment, lower illegal entryâ€™s, pushing back the ISIS movement, etc are all going great. I would prefer a national sales tax on everything except food and eliminate the IRS"
You are up against the crazed left and the two party swamp. Not an easy battle to win. Keep up the good fight for America.
Don't have to explain to me.  I understand what you meant.  I fortunately those who are offended choose to hear words and not the meaning. We can all pick apart our words.  Unfortunate because there are other issues that are important. They will find fault no matter what
Durbin should have never said anything. That's why it's called a private meeting. A tattle tale. Only wants to hurt the  government which is also his ( Durbins) government. This type of behavior is why all the division. Stop breeding hate.
"People who love watching entertainment which contains not only language much more offensive than the word s#$#hole, as well as absolutely disgusting acts, and who probably use fouler language, are now feigning shock and are so totally offended. Give me a break.While s#$#hole is not a word to be used in ""polite"" company, it was used accurately in what was supposed to be a closed meeting. That race card is getting a little worn and tattered from overuse.You can bet much fouler and offensive things have been said in closed door meetings but were never leaked through the media because it wouldn't have served the preferred narrative."
Those countries sadly have some evil leaders... when our country sends supplies that are needful to help those suffering... much of it is stolen before it reaches those in need. So many good people from our country do try and help... their govt are thieves. That's the truth.
What about the leaking when is someone going to be held accountable for leaking this was a private meeting how is it  just being overlooked the President has a the right to say the truth but the leakers do not have the right to take it to the media and put there own spin on what the President says to benefit there own agenda. Drain The Swamp!!!!?
I am sure you said it in frustration.  Just admit it and keep working hard for the American people.   You canâ€™t always say whatâ€™s on your mind with so many people waiting to get you for it.
"Record all meeting when Dems are around and make sure you have REAL Republicans with you, Lame-O-Graham or Flake doesn't count!"
"Record every meeting, post it for us to hear, that way I can shove it in my sister's face, cause she believes the main stream media, she also believes super market tabloids about women giving birth to alien babies"
"trump is SO NOT PRESIDENTIAL!  No past, or present day, Head of State speaks like that. He's talking to his trailer trash supporters. That's exactly why he's always wanted to be accepted by the Billionaire class, and they ALL SHUN HIM!  He IS TRAILER TRASH."
Trump is Jewish he is the billionaire class. his grandmothers last name is kolber. He is one of them just playing the fake christian patriot. He does not know the words to the National anthem which is sad.
"so you're calling all (it was claimed by numerous people in the meeting) the senate members in attendance who reported your rant liars? Why would anyone work for such a dishonest, manipulative liar. You should be ashamed"
So when is Jake Tapper gonna release the source who leaked info from a closed door meeting. He should be forced to give his source. Personally I think it was made up by him.
We love you and you are doing amazing things for our beloved country.  We are so blessed to have you.  Thank you!
Those third world countries are crap holes. We are bringing in welfare Dem voters. Sometimes the truth hurts..
MAGA Morons are governing America!  Novemeber 2018!!
"Don't back down Mr President! STAY STRONG!! They ALL forget what they have said!! Especially Pelosi, that CRAZY HAG!!!!"
Did you really trust the liberals?I think you are better than that.You are the best thing to happen to America!I appreciate you and V-P Pence more than you know.51 yrs old and never registered to vote until you ran for office.Thankyou and V-P Pence so very much.I love you guys.When are White House I nvitations
Third world countries are corrupt for the last 60 years ...that's no secret ...in fact I live in one billions are sent out to sitter land bank accounts while the countries starves ...I live in one ...it is shitholes
Truth hurts!  If your country only survives because others feed you and pay your way you have failed!!!  End all foreign aid!  We are not the worlds savior
"Don't worry Mr President...those places ARE shitholes!  If they weren't, they wouldn't need OUR tax dollars for ""relief"" and citizens of said shitholes wouldn't be risking their lives to come here illegally.  Funny how upset the snowflakes are over a statement of fact about 3rd world dumps but have nothing to say about what Libtards say about their own citizens living in Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Tennessee, Missouri or Kentucky.  2020 is yours sir and please keep up the great work!"
Remember when Trumps charity raised money to help Haiti but it never got there and instead he used his charity to pay for his daughters wedding?  Oh no wait that was the Clintons....

"How many other countries are as welcoming as the USA?  We, the people, help others.  Disgusting to see how the media, politicians, and others jump on the bandwagon to trash our President.  We know you want the best for our country so we can always help others.  If we fall, who will help the world?"
Probably a good idea... that might take care of this but then they will  still make up stuff even though I really don't see anything wrong with what he said ... it's what his supporters think .
This man is suffering from dementia. He is suffering from short term memory loss. Now he really  confirmed that he is the sh...hole. what an airhead. Unbelievable that America have this caricature as president. _Ÿ™„_Ÿ™„_Ÿ™„_Ÿ™„
What does it say about the people who continue to support this manâ€™s vile words?  â€œHalf of his supporters are deplorableâ€ù is proving to be an accurate statement.
"I love that political correctness is out the window. But, seriously, I don't believe that he used that term in a meeting. I'd love to know the ""unnamed sources"" that the Washington Compost are using this time."
"Have all phones and recording devices picked up in a room before the meeting, limit the unnecessary people, and have your own recording device on the conference table. Or televise the whole meeting to the public."
"Is anyone surprised at the Leftist hysteria on this? They flop from one ""scandal"" to the next, leaving the last one behind as soon as something more titillating comes along."
"The more meetings you hold with the Democrats, the more they stab you in the back like Feinsteinâ€™s shenanigans the other day.  Offer them free counseling since they canâ€™t get over their loss last November."
"Its the truth anyway. I mean why do we take people from these poverty sewer holes? They come here take advantage of our system and stay there, we need people with brains and not with their hands out."
"help them there. Do not bring them here any more  Never. All of them Get a Marshall Plan in place. and a General to run it with accountants overseeing the books. it can be fixed over there, even if the clintons have stolen billions from them\"
Guard yourself at all cost. Praying a hedge of protection around you. The devil is angry. You're doing good work. We love you.
Yes Mr. President. RECORD ALL MEETINGS no matter where you are. Carry a digital recorder and start it every time a conversation begins. The only way to protect you from the shark infested waters that surround you.
Your followers do not listen to fake media. No need to tell us you didn't because we don't care if you did or not.  You seem to say what others are thinking.  I like that about you. If some day I could be in the position to do the same I would also.
"There should be protest against the mainstream media for spoiling someone's name. They must pay heavily and their licence withdrawn.I know what it feels like when there is a gang up to spoil your name . Most people will believe it."
zionist media pushing the marxist left agenda
They can never be true friends of the populace
"Record all meetings with the opposition, unfortunately in Todayâ€™s loose lip and immoral world, this must be the rule rather than the exception. TRUMP!!!!!!!!! MAGA!!!!!!!!!"
"Fire everyone in the room.  Seriously tired of leaks than lies!  Every president Iâ€™m sure has had private conversations, sad someone feels the continual need to trash this one!"
I'm a big supporter and know you have Americans best interest in mind but with the way the liberals are in this country you gotta think before opening your mouth. You're just giving them fuel.
Why aren't the Republicans that were there coming out on public record like Democratic Senator Durban & say what exactly was said instead of only the Democrats
I guess this tweeting or twittering - whatever itâ€™s called I think it absurd that a Presdent if the United States does it - VERY unpresidential. I have to say that I recall that President Obama also did this nonsense - still it is a terrible way for a president to communicate and it means heâ€™s wasting time reading other comments - if heâ€™s responding to them. And so it goes.
I don't remember president Obama tweeting if I recall correctly he wasn't allowed to have a cell phone
"All presidents and politicians say their derogatory remarks,  the only difference is they say it in private or under their breathâ€™s the only difference with Trump is that he doesnâ€™t wear a mask he is upfront with his crap. I remember Bill Clinton saying about Obama â€œ He could have been serving as our coffee a few months back now look he is running for presidentâ€ù. What about Hillary calling a Hispanic engagement a taco bowl."
"Perhaps Trump is truly draining the Swamp in a much bigger Ring.Human Trafficking and Pedorings are bigger $$ than Oil, Minerals, Banks, Drugs, even War.Our Government and other Governments are full of corruption.In USA alone over 2200 missing children Per Day vanished without a trace. This doesn't include adults that's missing.Corrupt CIA, FBI agents,  military personnel, politicians.All you have to do is research and dig down deeply into the matter to start connecting the dots.All of Entertainment business, Countries that slavery still exists, missing children during Natural Disasters.Look how Clinton's aid and a register pedopile kidnapped children during Haiti disaster.Haiti law is death for kidnapping children. Yet Clinton's aid and known registered pedopile gets less than a year."
"Stop trying to explain yourself to these liberals youâ€™ll never get anything done. Just keep doing what you been doing, you just saying what majority of Americans been saying for decades, youâ€™re just brave enough to say it out loud! Weâ€™re behind you Mr President, donâ€™t stop!!!! Matter of fact maybe we should go back to our other motto â€œAmerica, love it or leave itâ€ù!"
Too bad the democrates and the fake news media canâ€™t attract mentality stable people in their ranks.  Who cares if the President did say shithole.  Most of the people sneaking into our country have come from shitholes or they would have stayed home.  Kevin Peterson
His position deserves a person with more dignity.  Be proud of our country and our people.
Donna Thompson He is proud of our country and people.  Were you proud of Obama when he put our country down everyday and on foreign soil.  He showed no dignity.  Were you proud of Obama when destroyed race relations that had significantly improved.  Were you proud of Obama when he bowed to foreign leaders.  Were you proud of Obama when he lied to the people that you could keep your doctor and insurance and pay $2500.00 less for coverage.  Obama had no dignity and was the laughingstock of the world.
You can't trust hardly any of them just out for there self and that's only..you have to Mr Trump take care and cuver your a.. you no what I mean you are doing a great job keep going drain that swamp thank you so much
We know how the DEMOCRATS work .... It's sad that most are blind to it ! What will they throw at you next ? PRESIDENT DONALD J TRUMP don't  trust those who are loosing power. They will do anything to get it back.
"â€œThis happens when a country raises its children on the myth of exceptionalism that says the United States is the only place on earth that has God's blessing. The only place that matters. It happens in a country where exotic travel means crossing a state border for cheaper booze and where a passport is less important than a Sam's Club membership card. It happens in a country where ignorance about the rest of the world is allowed to endure.â€ù  And as said before â€œThis is no longer about Donald Trump, what he said and did.  All presidents come to reflect America, our values, reflect who we are, and the question we have to ask ourselves is: Is this an accurate reflection of who we are?â€ù"
the intervention of voters that illeagaly voted many times and being immagrants were definitley a threat to our true security of this nation.....they arent us they just want what they can get for free thats all
Start recording all the future meetings that way durbin and his ilk will not be able to make outlandish claims.  Where possible air meetings like you did on the immigration meeting.
For gods sake Trump! Will you please just either learn to form a coherent sentence or better yet stay away from social media. It's like a 24 hour invite to drunk friends 3am ramblings.
Let me help you out Sir. Haiti â€œISâ€ù a shithole. Along with every predominantly Black Country or city on earth. Proven time and time again.
"exactly their all against you and will cause you trouble and grief every chance they get that is both sides they want you gone you are messing up their little slush funds they had going don t trust anyone just my opinion, i still say they have made a deal among themselves on how to get you impeached and hand over one of the houses to dems, then get the two thirds to vote you out be prepared"
He finally realizes you can't trust the snakes in the grass.  They don't want to work together to better America they just want to trash the President and will do anything to make themselves more electable!
We still love u. You called it like it is. If their countries were so great why do they want to leave?
"Great idea POTUS. Record anything you do and say from now on to shut these demons and libs up once and for all !!  Iâ€™m so sorry you are facing such opposition!!  ;-("
Stick to your original comments during the election season that these countries donâ€™t send us their best and brightest... few do but most do not... nothing wrong with coming here to make things better for your family but it must be done legal...
"Your doing what you said you would do, thatâ€™s all that matters. Left has to try to demonize you. No worries we got your back Mr. President."
"Couldnâ€™t make anything up in that open meeting with press so Dem. took this opportunity to start something else... Hey, make all meetings open to press unless itâ€™s security ...let them wiggle trying act like they are so sweet and itâ€™s them who wants opposite... When press has camera in there a total different story isnâ€™t that weird?"
"DJT, that's why we all know God is #1 & he says we don't have to take revenge, but to leave room for his Wrath - God will take care of those people! He sees all, and will deal with those people! Your doing a great job, and #WeThePeople are sooo proud of you!! #MAGA"
Can these elected officials not do their jobs without stirring a pot! The people didnâ€™t put them in office to gossip and carry  inaccurate information to the media. Nor did they put them in office to take  vacations every two weeks and still getting paid.
"lies and lies. You will end up as the most hated man in America. How can you deny what you said, when two people (one dem and one Republican) have said,....yes, you said these words. Your orange nose is growing"
You Sir are supported by my husband and I. We know the folks trying to flock here are from bad countries otherwise why do they want to leave their home countries? Keep up the great work!
We know that anything spewed out of a Democrats mouth is a LIE.... they wouldnâ€™t know the truth if it bit them in the Butt!!!!!  Keep up the great work President Trump you having them CRYING themselves to Bed every night _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
"I agree.  I think Mr. Trump will be the best President weâ€™ve ever had.  So far he has been despite the Dems, Liberal and some Media have treated him.  He canâ€™t get any respect no matter how much heâ€™s accomplished.  No other President has accomplished as much in a year."
Why is it sir that no Republican members in the room when you called other countries SHITHOLES have yet to deny the statement you made?
"Clinton Foundation took the money and it never got to the Haitians! They own a telephone Co, private secluded property there. Just ask missionaries that go there and they can tell you the truth about whatâ€™s going on there!"
"""Just like she did with American health care funds when she was secretary of state"". Hitchens"
"As usual and customary. It's not what he said. Even if you take at face value. It's what he excluded from the statement. As you say Neil.  What did he say about the ""other  's.... Bag countries"""
"Mister Trump eventually you will have to do that. Among those who don't like you exists a deep distrust for you and your actions. :( :( Pls don't be unjust to other people, it is against the Law of God."
"Perhaps it could have been worded a little differently, but it wasn't like he called the people ##hole! He was referring to the country's economy! Some people are just too sensitive!"
I believe this used to be business as normal between the FDR and RMN years. Maybe it's time to start recording meetings and telephone calls again. Oh wait - NSA is probably recording everything already.
I love that you are my president and have confidence that you will do what's best for us in many ways. I really wish you would stop and pray about speaking or tweeting before putting it out there. Please!
"Praying for you President Donald Trump, your blamed for everything, we know the Clinton's took $13 million of the Haitians money"
Prayers are for him always
Oh go pray to the SKY FAIRY you two....LMAO!
You merely said that it would be wise to have a balance between immigration from rich and poor nations. Well developed nations invest more in their citizens than poor nations and you simply said that you wanted a balance between developed and underdeveloped sources of immigration in the interest of the American people. This is all you said...epithets aside.
"I don't care if he said it or not; truth is they are s--t hole countries. Keep up the good work DJT I appreciate the fact we have a CIC who fights for ""We the people"" and not these foreign countries. M.A.G.A.!"
That's exactly the way I feel about that. Well said Tommy Taylor
Any country ran by democrats is or could be a s#@%hole hahahaha
Trump has def done more good in the short few months he's been President  than Obama did in his 8 years
Sticks and stones may break your bones.... You all know the rest so get over it and move on and do something constructive for a change.... Everyone else has thought and said a lot worse just in general
"I agree none of those countries are shitholes so we should stop all US funding to those great up and coming countries! The left supports that, been listening to them all day telling us how great these countries are! _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚"
"The only shitholes that I know of are liberally run Detroit, Chicago, San Francisco and New York City with mentionables coming as Cleveland, Cincinnati, Baltimore!"
"The medias are so good at interpreting wrong the information to create some problems. It would be have been a big mistakes if Trump would have treaten these countries like they are **** b3cause the united states should regroup every culture as they always did.At the same time , we both know these countries has a lot of problems I understand he doesn't want immigrated people that comes to do nothing and bring some drugs or violence .We don't have to generalize these countries, as long as they work hard and their purpose is to get a job and to make a difference they are welcome in the United States!"
"So everyone even Fox News wants to believe the journalist after all the Fake and untrue news for over a year they dish out about our Great President. They all owe our President an apology, and should face penalties for being a leaker but also a leaker of lies."
Lmao stop trying to back track ...whatâ€™s done is done so just move forward haha reminds me of your pussy grabbing comment ....that wasnâ€™t me even though you directly apologized ....grow a pair
Heard a female fox commentator say on outnumbered that he said it on purpose to distract the media while he dose important business . I rewound it and listened again because I couldn't believe it .that is the level of their reporting
I totally agree with Nancys comment.  You are by far the best this country has seen.  My husband and I enjoy your blunt and truthful way of speaking.  You say everything we have said in our own home.We do see the light at the end of  the tunnel and feeling otimism for the first time since Ronald Reagan.
"I don't understand why you wouldn't just record everything you say in meetings,especially behind closed doors.Im sick of liars twisting your every word! Do you think repealing the smith-mundt modernization Act of 2012  would help make America great again? This doesn't seem to be helping us bring down the deficit and it's just plain wrong for the WORLD as a whole!"
Its funny how all the former administration's cast blame on Our President for the bad things they have done. Illinois politicians are crooked as all hell and always have been.
"Where is all the outrage for our President when he and his family are threatened,ridiculed, bullied. This is all we hear a lie on him. President Trump had to LOVE Americans or he would not have ran for President."
The Dems can't handle the success trump is having and are doing their best to sabotage him at every turn....they disgust me
The Clinton Organized Crime Family stole a boatload of money intended for Haiti.  No one wants to talk about that.
Itâ€™s pretty obvious that you did and you should sincerely apologize for your comments. No ifs no buts just apologize! You will win in the long run if you do. My two cents of advice to you Mr President!
"True, so that means Everyone who attended this meeting are liars and only Trump is the truth teller.  Maybe someone ought to read him the fable about ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"""
"Knowing our President is a decent, human being and those opposing his aggressive agenda are social aggravators, agitators, and they need to build anarchist alliances, to threaten conservative ideals, by opposing conservative activists, by mischaracterizing their views, their ideas, their opinions, their speech, in short our agenda, by using all means that they feel justifies their ideological preference. If you believe socialism offers a utopian life its you they use to distract you from the truth historically proven, you react to their accusations, and speculations rather than questioning the obnoxious ways they attack those with different opinions."
You have done more for our Country in the short time you have been in office than most did in the time they were in all together...Keep up the good work and don't let anyone bring you down...I stand with you
That statement has been disputed by attendants of the meeting. Given your consistently proven lack of honesty and integrity I am inclined to believe Mr Durbanâ€™s statement.
All these people( a lot are teens and grown ups with a big  mouth ) dying for attention. Do they think we need people like this. They look like Bullies to me. Send them home they are lost send out an Amber Alert.
"I think people with an ability to hear and see will automatically understand that Trump said those things.  Trumpâ€™s track record on ignorant pronouncements and lying is long and thanks to digital recording everlasting.  If you support Trump why wring your hands and try to deny his words and actions?  You voted for him because he is crass and speaks your language, rails against the system that let your job go away and he is,somehow, a great businessman.  He has in fact made money but has done so by refusing to pay small business for services render knowing full well that the small business will not have the funds to pursue him in court.  These businesses built or made cabinets, furniture,draperies for his golf clubs, hotels and towers. When it was time to pay Trump would refuse to as matter of his business practice Ultimately many were forced into bankruptcy.  Trump has also declared bankruptcy at least 3 times for himself.  How these bankruptcies justify his being some kind of business wiz is beyond me. Just embrace this ignoble man child that speaks your language, lies daily and brings an endless stream of shame to our nation.  It sad that he is our president.  It is sad that his supporters donâ€™t see the harm in him."
"THANK YOU, Roseanne Napier-Riddick!! You certainly hit the nail on the head.  It is so very very sad and heartbreaking that there are people in America who refuse to see the danger that this man is capable of causing...he is unpredictable, wishy-washy and lies to cover himself constantly.  Too bad that 1/3rd Americans believe in him NO MATTER if he lies or what stupid thing he says.  Just cannot understand.....it's unbelievable!!"
It is a lot of pictures fake news I want I want to hear the audio tape you know the Democrats are saying this believe the Democrats don't want anyone to succeed but their own agenda to make more taxes for more people to put more people in poverty to have more and more default and they don't come to the table because they just don't want him to succeed well believe me the world is going to see more Republican and besides the United States is America we don't care about the rest of the world we have to take care of herself close the border build a wall and make more jobs for us then let the rest of the world come back and fight for what they want a piece of America God Bless America

"We believe you. Durbin has been caught in so many lies. MSM has done the damage. Yes, record everything. Just continue all the great things your doing. America is already great again because of YOU. Thank you & God Bless you."
"@Donald Trump no, you should and should have been recording them. Then make those people eat their own words, even though they would work overtime to find a way to say that it was a doctored recording"
Sen. Durbin was interviewed by WGN this morning and he was just aghast at the behavior of Trump in the Oval Office. He must've forgotten about LBJ banging his girlfriends there and Bill Clinton getting his knob polished there. Oh the horror.
God bless our President at this time of attacks from the Democratic party.    He has turned out country around from being totally destroyed by then democrats.   Obama added 10 trillion dollars to our debt and has absolutely nothing to show for it except a perfect mess and the country unsafe
We elected you!  Shameful on the media for questioning you!  Sad day for America treating our greatest President ever this way!  We do not even pay attention to the stupidity.  Keep up the great work!  We know who is behind it!  We know!
"Dont worry about it Mr. President.  Remember President Johnson, was a very crude individual and the media and his party stayed quiet.  You might want to remind the Democratics this next time they attack you!"
"this has been going on for years, my son, and myself have lost so many people due to you and mckesson corporation haitians! shame on you mr trump. on my way home from work saw my neighbor outside with a police officer, new it was about phil a boy, a man who struggled with opiotes his father found him  dead. but he was doing well. just couldnt get away from it. he was a good friend of this famiy and i am sick of you all not doing what should have done. all these parents should sue mckesson and the drugmaker,,take tylenol.."
"Melbourne has become so unsafe and many women have been threatened with rape after rubbish migrants from the continent are brought.Australia needs a Trump!!!"

"Just a hint to all the jealous badmouthing ""who so evers"" ...if you're blessed, you CAN'T be cursed ....so eat your hearts out... this brilliant President is going NOwhere very soon. I salute you, mr President."
Dear President Trump..   I am so sorry you have to defend your every move and every world you say.  Just know that the majority of the country is proud of you.  Keep fighting for us and hang in there..
idiot. He lost the popular vote and his approval rating keeps dropping. Where do you even get your information?!
And yours from where? The Trump Propoganda Network and Twitter? Jesus H Christ
Look at what the Clintonâ€™s did to Haiti!!! They lined their pockets with cash meant for Haitian Relief!
Yes you probably should record.  Funny from the president who is forbidding his staff to even have their phones in the West Wing.  Full of crap!

We have to bring in the worlds best in order to compete in the future or we will cease to be a super power and all that goes with it.  This PC Climate has got to end.

It would be great if someone recorded it and the truth came out. Senator Durban was there and he claims Trump said it all. Who is lying?
"I never pay attention to that. They always lie. You're not that dumb.'They' are acting out again.You should record all those meetings.But you should also clean house...."
"Yep, recording them might be a good idea. But the left and dems, and crooked MSM will still twist it to the cool aid drinkers..."

Triggered. LOL And you criticize Trump you dumb hypocrite . STFU and grow up.
Eat a dick Trumptard!
"No ~ No one in the meeting has said he said that.  What was reported was that someone from the meeting ""briefed"" someone from the meeting and that someone told a reporter.   Geeeeesh!   We all know they like to ""interpret"" rather than report what is really said.   Report the news ~ I'll do my own interpretation!!"
Ummm....no. Go back and do your research. Senator Durbin himself verified the story. He was in the meeting. Stop drinking the trump-aid.
"I have a question.....if Donald Trump himself admitted to saying those things, would it change your opinion of him? Would you still support him??"
Of course.....NOW you all have nothing to say.........

"Everyday i get up,I ask,what evil is the snakes stirring up today? And even you would've Mr.President,It would be true,Not so much the people ,but the _Ÿ’© hole leaders they have."
"One lie, wrapped in another lie, then layered in lies like a lasagna. Trump is a disgrace to the office and proves it on a daily basis."
The demoncrats come out of a meeting with President Trump and the first thing they do is tell massive lies against President Trump and our Country! And I forgot to mention there were establishment Republicans that went along with this crap also! Further proof that term limits are desperately needed!

"After Dems and MSM have spent 24 hours saying what wonderful prosperous countries those places are, it negates any excuse of not sending the illegals home.  Deport them now!"
EXPOSED: How The Clintons Likely STOLE BILLIONS From World's Poorest in Haiti - The Clintons should return the money and go to prison!
"Yes please record,  it's the best way to dispel all this false made up stuff .... when I heard it this morning I almost threw a shoe @ the grinning reporter but realized I'd only hurt my TV!! ... these ravenous wolves are liars and thieves and will say anything ! PLEASE PROTECT YOURSELF!!"
"keep going with the over the top offensive stuff, its hilarious. You can call a place crappy, and have great people from it, but people get all butthurt about everything these days."
He didnâ€™t say take them out he said they are shitholes. BTW Norway was just voted the happiest people on the world. Why on earth would they want to come here?
"Mr. President, You must protect yourself. It's wonderful to have freedom of speech but we also have freedom to lie and twist whatever anyone says or does. Praying for you."
"If you recorded them would you own up to the things you say during the meetings, or would you and your team deny the audio is even you?  Just like a few other things recently."
"Breaking News: Trump cancels his State Trip to London and surprise, surprise, blames OBAMA. In his latest tweet, Trump cites the reason he is not going to London was because of the new US Embassy: "" I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for â€œpeanuts,â€ù only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!"" So for Republicans who may be unaware, Trump fails to mention that the reason the government decided to move the embassy was to increase security after a perceived terrorist threat in 2002, that the ""off location"" property was purchased in October of 2008 (before Obama was even elected) and that the plan was approved by Congress. But, hey, when has Trump ever let facts get in the way of a good old rousing rant of insecure spite and jealousy? Of course, the REAL reason for the cancellation is that many Londoners have made it clear that Donald Trump is not welcome and was planning to organize a mass protest. That makes you think just how Trump has succeeded in alienating the USA from the world and so much for those ""great deals"". So lets see how Americans will fare on January 20th on the National Walk for impeachment. The world is protesting yet still the silence in the USA is deafening."
London is a SH^*HOLE now! Because morons like you have destroyed it. You all are so up on bashing Trump yet you let the Obamas and Clintons get away with actual treasonous acts. Ur an ignorant fool.
Do you like that he lies all the time.
Why are you reading his support page if you think he's so bad?  Move and MAGA!  Get a real job on the way!
"David Singer You sure know enough about holes, sounds like you're the one from a hole!"
He a very stable genius hope he gets brain scan at his physical today. Oh and then off to play golf at Mar a Largo
David Singer he doesnâ€™t lie all the time. Research something. Stop parroting what the media tells you. Think for yourself.
all you have to do is listen to him and here the lies media doesn't have anything to do with today he lied about saying shitholes even those many have already corroborated his statement.
"Durbin has a history of misrepresenting conversations, so you know he has some political agenda in trying to misreport an off-the-record conversation which no one will verify."
"Excuse me, I just believe that excuse...especially since a few Republicans in the room have already agreed that they heard #45 say exactly what Dick Durbiin heard him say!!"
Correction...do NOT believe that excuse.
"Donna Thompson Then you should explain the lack of outrage when Obama used the same ""word"" on camera to describe Libya in an interview.  The only apology I would personally offer, if I were Trump, is for having invited Durbin to the Whitehouse for an off-the-record meeting only to have Durbin waste everyone's time."
Ken Costich I heard this week that the DOJ has opened an investigation into the Clinton Foundation.  Finally!
"You called it a ""Shithole"" country. Not derogatory? Vocabulary and public speaking lessons would prove helpful. Please, for the love."
"There are conflicting statements, and isn't for sure what he said. Can't believe ANY politician on what was said behind closed doors, regardless of party."
Hay que ampliar los escenarios polÃ_tico econÃ_mico social en todo porque en la uniÃ_n estÃ¡ la fuerza para ir fuerte y con todo y el Estado de MÃ©xico a la vanguardia o no? hay Del Mazo nos mata jajajaja pero no importa tiene a los jÃ_venes todos y  de todos los paÃ_ses.

"Haitians Papa Doc and Baby Doc, and African Edi Ameen (sp?) are just three examples of the multitude of corrupt leaders who have taken our money and used it for themselves, instead of for food, housing, medical care for the poor people in their nations for whom it was intended! OUR President is putting a stop to our nation being taken advantage of, and if you do not have enough commonsense to appreciate that, you have my sympathy!"
"True, you trusting  people  must be hard.  More  yet,  be careful!! I think  you're  doing  a fine job. My  opinion!!!!"
"Maybe, itâ€™s time other Republicans start pushing back on the liberal Democrats and start calling them out for what they are!"
The real S***hole here is the guy that walked out of a private meeting and ran his mouth about what was said in that meeting.
I totally agree Ron Steward I been texting my hand off due to my same comment as yours HOWEVER they don't get it.im glad you do
Private meetings are necessary to let people tell how they really feel and express themselves in a way to get their point across without public scrutiny. The agreement that is come to could be different from what was said in the meeting. When the privacy is breeched it destroys the usefulness of a private meeting. It also causes mistrust.
that wold be the chicago libtard durbin  a known liar and not his first leak of private meetings
matter of  fact he is the only one at thhhe meeting to make this claim
Come on just face it and explain what you meant and admit it was a foot in mouth moment. We ALL have them and being authentic WAY better than _Ÿ’©head posturing. Donâ€™t let the Swamp gobble you up.
"Did you notice no one was actually named as to have said it?  Just the good ole Washingion Post reporting FAKE news again! Blank profile, Fake profile!"
Maxine Jacobson Ya but Durbin came out this morning and said itâ€™s true. And it probably is. So he should just own it and say sorry. Not try to skirt around it. That just makes him look so dishonest and foolish.
"There are American citizens living in the Appalachian mountains in shacks, no healthcare, no free anything. End DACA and help Americans first.  DACA was unconstitutional and should be ended"
"You are such a liar, unbelievable. Youâ€™re an embarrassment, totally unfit for the office you hold. No respect for anyone or anything"
Just like here in the Philippines mainstream media and opposition will twist whatever the president will say for the opposition politicians benefits.
"Even if you did call those countries shitholes, you wouldn't lose my support. Although distasteful for a nations leader to use that language, YOU ARE FAR FROM WRONG."
"Kepp talking to us about what your plans are regarding everything you do. The people that have faith in you are hanging on every word, and we appreciate you giving us YOUR WORDS as in the plain truth in ways that truth can't be diluted and distorted. WE LOVE THAT! America's greatness will not be restored without pushback from its destroyers. WE KNOW THAT! But with the grit and determination you possess as well as the fighting spirit that made this country great, WE HAVE THAT! We cannot be defeated, you know your constituency is the entire country and even though we present challenges, God will not give you more than you can handle. You were chosen by the people because they could see your determination going in and we wanted you to lead this country back to former greatness. God Bless Donald Trump and God Bless America."
"He isn't wrong about some of these countries being crapholes so why would he deny saying.  Their government wants it that way, more control.  Welcome to socialism."
"I love the boldness, confidence, and fearless spirit in you, right on God will keep strengthening you."
Yes mr. Trump you should record them that way when the dams open their mouth you can play it back and close their mouths really really quick with the truth Democrats just can't handle the truth
"We know you were talking about the country and it's living conditions, and not the people.  Our mainstream media are a bunch of vicious vultures that sat silent for 8 years of Obama and Hillary.  NOT  A WORD ABOUT THEIR TREASONOUS ACTIONS!  Stay strong President Trump.  I don't know how you do it!!!!"
If he said cesspool would that make everybody feel better....NO...it doesnâ€™t matter what he says the left is gonna come unhinged......
I think you should put in a secret recording device in the White House for posterity purposes. Why not? Itâ€™ll be a great way to remember everything when you write your memoirs
"Democrats are known for their own lies & quick 2 forget their own comments - remember Clinton  - about his comment about Obama, Biden using the N word. Wasn't it the democrats who whated to keep slavery."
"Keep on doing ur amazing job. The liberala will always invent and twist whatever u say or do. The American people should be more than happy to have a Prez like you who standd up to the establishment, corrupt media, special interests etc.. in less than 1 year in office, the economy is  booming, jobs are created, companys are giving bonuses left and right etc.. i wish we had you in Canada. MAGA2020"
"The Democrats have been trying to commit a COUP on President Trump, it is plane as day.  They're could start a second Civil War if they continue on their stupidity."
"Donâ€™t worry, Mr. President, the Democrats tried to use the Haitian Plight and suffering in the past and the Haitian Community didnâ€™t buy what they are selling, and voted for you, unlike the American Left, the Haitian community doesnâ€™t let it self be used to promote the Left Agenda, they are smarter than that."
"Boy, they're  scraping for anything they can get or make up...those living glass houses shouldn't.....well, you know."
We have refugee programs for those people. This meeting was about immigration. We should only allow immigrants that are employable.
The closer we get to the corruption of the Liberals and FBI the more they unload their garbage. We must be on to something big.
"the left wing liberal dumbolecrats  will twist every word you say  to make you look ,,,bad,,lying  ,cheating,,silly ,,stupid,,,or what ever it takes  ...we  deplorables    love you just the way you are,,keep up the amazing job  your doing  ..Don;t  give the DACA  loves  Nothing  till we get the WALL MONIES...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11"
I do not believe the statement were said as reported but the President  is direct and said anything it was for a reason. To protect America. What exactly he said is up for debate.
"You should be free to discuss whatever you want in private meetings, that is the only way that these problems will get solved."
Haiti is a shithole.  I  don't want to live there.  How many of you big babies would move to Haiti?  None? Why?  Haiti is a shithole.   Simple.
"Record!  These Democrats are out to get You Mr. President, at every turn to DISRUPT YOUR AGENDA.  Trying to ruin every good thing you do....it's unbelievable!  Tell IT LIKE IT IS.....IT'S WAYYY OVERDUE."
"The man could say ""Hello, have a nice day."" and it would be twisted to something negative or derogatory.  #MAGA #PROUDOFMYPRESIDENT"
Keep moving forward Mr. President. The leftists are resorting to desperate moves. These are just distractions. The people that know whatâ€™s going on are behind you.
Hatia is corrupt and America has given millions upon millions to it We have seen America former Presidents exploit our giving and pocket millions with the extreme overhead and salaries of these group
"YES, they are troubled countries, have been there .... However as POTUS,  think and choose before saying words ..... Don't give the other side more ammo ..... Remember, there is more than one way to make a good landing :)"
"Haitians fought for the independence of the United States !!In 1779, a ship leaving Saint-Marc headed for the United States with valiant soldiers from Haiti. They were known as volunteer hunters from Santo Domingo, and they were part of what is often called the siege of Savannah or the battle of Savannah.The D'Estaing Division included 156 Volunteer Grenadiers from Cape Francis, 545 Volunteer Fighters from St. Dominic, and these included troops from Port-au-Prince and Cape Town, as Cap Haitian was then known. D'Estaing would have had 3500 troops, whether the number of free blacks and mulattoes is 800 or 1500, historians differ.And the battle of Savannah was not the only battle in which Haitians were involved. The historian and journalist Ralph Pezzullo highlights another battle that took place at Lynnwood Harbor off Florida in 1781, in which the British commander Lord Cornwallis was defeated by a fleet of Santo Domingo (the French colonial name of Haiti) . Historians point out that the Battle of Savannah played a crucial role in the American struggle for the independence of England, and that it was one of the bloodiest battles."
"It's the truth, why should we keep letting these people in from these hellholes, Regan said the same thing, did you hear about that, neither did I.."
"In fact, it was the George W. Bush administration that decided more than a decade ago to relocate the embassy during a worldwide push for greater security at U.S. diplomatic sites."
"Sir, you need to start recording everything. They are doing anything now to try to bring you down. All because they are getting found out now."
"Who should I trust, a media that twists and/or straight up lies about what POTUS says from day one or a POTUS that calls it like it is? I'll stick with MAGA"
"LOL!   Senators Graham, Flake, and Durbin gave you an immigration reform that was designed to set you off.   Never trust these three Senators again, to put Americans first."
"You have a Wonderful relationship with the Haitians??? Like your money laundering of â€œbaby Doc Duvalierâ€™sâ€ù Iâ€™ll-gotten gains some years ago, you mean?"
Set up cameras and recorders every time you have a meeting. Record them all for everyone to see! Nothing off the record that way.
"These liberals have not lived in these sâ€ùâ€ùthole countries as regular residents.  Have you experienced living under oppressors, dictators, corrupt bourgeoisie?  Those citizens feel hopeless thinking that nobody cares BUT sometimes a glimmer of hope and light peek in when someone especially like an important American tells it what it is and acknowledges reality.   Silence encourages oppressors...Go ahead and donâ€™t be tongue-tied. Say it what it is"
I have wonderful relations with Haitians. Surprised you didn't say you have the BEST relationships EVER. Listen to yourself. You have a vocabulary equal to dogs. About 50 words Mr. Stable Boy Genius.
"Unfortunately you have a history of lying and passing your lies off as fact, so you are simply not believable. That is not the result of political spin, itâ€™s the result of your own words."
It is a s**thole country disease ridden country that aids came from.. government corruption worse than ours...the people deserve better but they need to work towards that goal.
They just want to run you down.  We all say (WORD) regrets when over worked and under pressure.  Haitians are strong people they should rebuild their own country.
If your not for Trump you are against him...this is not the first bit of fake news and it won't be the last. Get real people. He has no reason to make a statement like that!
"Yes, record meetings. You cannot defend against anything unless there's contrary evidence. You already knew this though, right?"
"P.S.  Everyone with brains knows that CNN and MSNBC, the ""basement twins"", lie as much as satan.  They are as desperate as Hillary was on November 7th, 2016.  And thats pretty desperate."
"Yes you should record all meetings and released the recordingsEspecially the meetings with Russian lawyers, oligarchs and mobsters.If you are as innocent as you claim then the recordings will prove that."
"No worry Pres, dumbacrats opionions is like diet water......... I don't think I need to elaborate..... (well, the libs probably won't get it but they think their opinion matters so...)"
"End DACA concentrate on 200 million homeless. Donâ€™t be bullied by the democrat 8 your giving them their voter base the replacement Americans. You yourself canâ€™t just go into Mexico and become a citizen. Also, they have a heavily gated southern border with armed guards hypocrisy much. Build the wall. You may not hear from the silent majority but they are here.  You are our president. NO DACA itâ€™s unconstitutional."
"Unfortunately, today's media is nothing more than the propaganda arm of the leftist leaning Democrats...and some political elites who call themselves Republicans."
Maybe you should always read your tweets back to your Slovenian and Czechoslovakian wives before hitting the send button. Then you will fully understand how much of a knob you really are!
"They do t take care of their own stuff. Same,as South America as a whole. Corrupt government,  and the people will not grab their pitchforks and fight!!! Stay the course MR. President!! And thank you!!!"
"Bet this meeting was recorded so you can release the transcript.  The demonRATS can blame themselves along with Hitlery and her Clinton Crime Syndicate Clinton Foundation as they stole the funds which were raised for Haiti in the tens of Millions and left Haiti in worse condition than before.  Also need to investigate Hitlery's two corrupt brothers as it has been reported they confiscated the only working gold mine in Haiti and stole the gold.  #AmericaFirst!  #MAGA!  Prayers for all who are suffering especially our Veterans, our USA homeless and jobless."
You're a complete and utter embarrassment to our nation and the world. A new low for you but no surprise. As deplorable as they come.
"Probably should record future meetings because, unfortunately, no trust. Hey, look! I can agree with Trump!"
"Waiting for invitation to White House,hope to see you soon.God Bless America!Also,don't sign immigration bill unless you honestly support it.Dont take their bait,no one's at all."
"This is who the guy is .. there's a reason the Nazi's & KKK were walking around Charlottesville last summer saying ""Hail Trump ! "" He's on their side and they know it"
Idiot card goes to you.
Trumps is Jewish 100% not kkk. His grandmothers last name is kolber. He cannot sing the National Anthem. All of his children and business partners are Zionists. He is no christian patriot. He fights and works for Israel first
"When speaking of hard truths, genteel language is woefully inadequate. Leave romantic soliloquies to soft men, speaking of soft things."
"The Democrats are out to get you,  and make the USA a 3rd world Country they will lie and do what ever they can to do that.  All Americans need to take them out of Congress at the next election"
"We got your back prez. I fight night and day to balance the truth to people against enemy propaganda. Keep draining the swamp and get Hillary and all her corrupt cronies. God bless and keep on keeping on!!!! F the elite!!! #antinwo1luv"
You know what?? If these places weren't s#$& hole countries then maybe more of the immigrants here would be back in there home countries utilizing all their countries opportunities instead of the USA's
Would you rather have a pussyfoot that talks a smooth talk as heâ€™s selling your country down the river? OR... a REAL leader that talks the talk and walks the walk?  I know which one gets my support!
"Newsflash: the democrats want to destroy you and your agenda! WHY would you think they can be ""trusted"". They care about NOTHING except being in power."
Every family in Haiti could have a home if the Clontons  would have gave the money donated. Plus money left over
"Never mind them. We love you. A good man will scold and chatise whom he loves. We love your approach.  We Africans need to wake up. But remember, there are people in bondage in Africa who need freedom and independence from the hazrdous entities that exist as soveriengn countries. A Biafran independent nation from nigeria is one ezample.  If you are against President Trump, you belong to the dark world. God bless a forthright president. God bless the upright man. God bless Trump. God bless America."
Killary is the true devil to Haitians for absconding with donations earmarked for them through her corrupt Clinton Foundation scheme!! Bravo President Trump!!
It would be wise to record everything that you say in public because you give liberal a speck of dust and before you know it you've got a mountain that's erupting like a volcano
"Seems like the Dems care more about other countries people _Ÿ˜¡ we will remember this come election time!President Trump is the only one putting Americans first!"
"Honestly, why in Godâ€™s name should we expect you to be telling the truth on this? Itâ€™s your word against congressmen from both parties. You are a pathological liar."
"Itâ€™s the opposition looking for something derogatory about you.  Their followers believe them, ( I have heard this before from others)not us your voters we are not their robots."
"Or....vote the democrat party out of existence. All they do is lie, obstruct, steal, and pad their lavish lifestyles while America goes without."
Good idea. I think recording your meetings would/could be a good idea. How long have you been in office and the media still misrepresent you?
"From now on, Mr. President... I will only trust what I see you tweet or actually say visually.The MSM can't be trusted with Any news whatsoever.Keep up the Great work sir.Bill in Florida"
"This is all media reported on, not one word was any agreements worked out. i just quit listening to media. just turn channel or shut off when major news stations are on."
Don't worry about the haters Mr. President...they're not going away...just keep doing all the good you're doing...MAGA!
Anyone whoâ€™s ok with has no idea of being poor or having things happen to them beyond there control potus  is wrong on all levels and an  f ing   joke
Yes. Please record all meetings. Protect yourself. We love you and understand. The left can say anything they want. Too bad for them. So please so what you need to do !!!!
"My conservative stance here. I happily voted for Mr. Trump. Actions speak loader than words to a point, and in this case I am concerned. Eventually POTUS needs to find a filter that he uses 100% of the time before he speaks, tweets etc. If this is true that he was as outlandish as is being reported I am very disappointed. He almost always takes a step forward, to inevitably step back. I am tired of it. Holding out hope here, but he needs to stop being so bombastic and just do what he has been doing."
"I am from a shiethole country, came to USA almost 60 years ago.  Worked as a nurse for 35 years and proudly can say that I gave the best I had, working sometimes 18 to 20 hours on one shift to help all kind of people. And what makes me more proud is to say that I am a Salvadorean Nurse. A Nurse made in El Salvador to work and help in the US,"
Does this mean he did say something derogatory about Salvadorans and people from African Nations? So even in his denial he has a backhanded cleansing admission?  _Ÿ_”_Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜µ
Praying for you daily and praying that all Christian Americans realize the power of prayer...and a praying nation....and are doing the same.  You were elected because God himself wanted you there!!!!
Yes you should record every meeting that involves the Dems! Protect yourself like youâ€™re trying to protect the country w/ Immigration Reform
"Mr,trump as a president of the US that your are, do you really know the role Africa played to get America to this level that yourself are proud of today? If only you can stop shouting nonsense that'll makes more charismatic president else you are not! Or the White house officers should urge for psychologists otherwise you'll collapse the united States."
The same ones that gasp over curse words use far less comfortable language about conservatives and Christian folk on an hourly basis.
"Praying for trustworthy people for you Mr. President. We the people, hear your hearts cry in this matter. You are not alone. God is with you and He  provides what you have need of. God bless you President Trump!"
Amen!!!
"Yeah it's okay for our own citizens to stand in the streets and call our own country a shithole but God forbid somebody call an ace what it is, an ace"
So they say trump said something he should not have. But they dont care what Hillary did to them. The libs are out of their minds anymore...
"Trump they asked for transparency, give it to them. Since no matter if u had a cure for cancer they gonna go after u. Is this another Kelly amne Conway couch twist type thing?"
Come on Dems....you're really looking beyond rediculous!!! Those obscene hats you're wearing must be cutting off the circulation to your brain. Educate yourself.
"A lot of Trump supporters, and even Trump himself, have suggested he should have used cameras to document what was REALLY said, since this was obviously just ""another lie from the libtard, leftist, communist democratic snowflakes"". Well, there's only one problem with that; Trump has on numerous occations proved that he has absolutely no problems with denying even stuff that has been recorded, or otherwise documented beyond any doubt. And his supporters will take his word over any proof any day of the week..."
"You should wear a wire where ever you go and during whatever you do from now on.  The Lame-stream media will slander you and your family, twist your words, then call you obscene names at the drop of a hat.  Have the evidence at the ready to prove them wrong as you have on so many other occasions.  In fact if you start suing for slander and character deflamation you just might recoup some of that money you spent during the primaries."
Not only libs will run their mouth's about you but jealous Republicans will too their are many that only want to promote themselves.
Hey president Trump the southern states needs road equipment for icy conditions.  We have all this new industry coming in but folks cant get to work because of roads.
"Shame on the Clintons!  Mr. President...no one cursed worse than L. B. Johnson, but I guess that was OK? So tired of these double standards. When do the rest of those Kennedy Reports come out? _Ÿ_”"
"Good idea to ""record future meetings. "" Trust must be earned and the MSM and Dems have not earned it. Praying for you, Mr. President."
"You should record every meeting, so you can always go back and prove the haters wrong. You're doing a great job, Mr. President!"
"I am happy with our President Donald J. Trump, but Mr. President STOP YOUR TWEETS, you make good decisions and gain good marks then you tweet something and wipe out all those good marks plus, so my recommendation Mr. President is to SHUT THE HECK UP."
You need to record and vedio everything. But it's a shame you have to do it. But I'm the new world we love in it would be worth it
The hypocrisy of the Media knows no bounds. I worked at NBC for 30 years (I was the Closet Conservative). If you want to hear obscene language---go into a TV Control Room.
Just do whats right for Americans! How you talk when negotiating behind closed doors is none of our business! MAGA!
Trump speaks his mind! That's one thing I like about him He's not a hypocrite like some of the rest  I say God Bless him and protect him
Even though you didnâ€™t say what the lying media reported  what they said that you said. I wished you did say it. Because most Americans probably said the same thing. Enough said!
"Dems are so sanctimonious.  Like they never say things like that!  Shoot, they say it about some cities and citizens of this country.  Hypocrites."
"When the President starts publicly referring to other countries as ""shitholes"" there is a major problem. He is the President, who represents ALL Americans, not only the idiots that elected him."
yeah like taco heads was it?
"The media has become, retarded. You can lie part of the time to some people, but what you cant is to lie to all the people all the time. Inspired by President Abraham Lincoln words."
Haitians and some others from countries are not the people who should be here they have nothing of highly educated values to off our country. Many from Nigeria are catfishing and scamming millions for dollars from older Americans.
Probably living in CO in public housing..driving cabs and smoking dope
Yes record everything because as time goes by they will make up more lies. Sad you have to protect yourself but ever stop being you!!!!!
"I agree with you.....and I want to state here that Nigeria is nothing  but a disaster, so sorry I might  offend some people, but it remains the truth... I mean horrible!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Regardless of the challenges facing any particular country it is inappropriate, unprofessional, and dangerous for the President to stoop so low as to publicly use the word ""shithole"" in reference to a country."
We have everything here but they make it difficult for a common man
Yes....I believe you but the situation here call for public insult so our leaders can sit up....
President Trump should have all meetings with the Democrats taped and recorded.  That will put an END to the majority of lies.
Except that it was bipartisan and no one denied you said and the White House did not deny you said it. You are the only liar here.
You're an idiot.
"Dan Widomski Excellent reply and completed unsurprised. I recommend that you work on the substance though. Btw, I am just a stable genius_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚"
"Ann Bendet: that's the Mantra of the Trump base. Dems are responsible, Obama or Clinton did it. Snowflakes, libtards trolls... that's all they know other than Trump is their false god. Blaming the Dems when it is also being confirmed by repubs that were there, jeez! How brainwashed can you be."
Well he isn't far from the truth about these 3rd world countries. If they were such havens then why is it then Western Countries are being inundated with migration from these miss managed poorly run countries.
"Calling a country a â€œshitholeâ€ù is just stating what others think!!! If it is NOT a â€œshitholeâ€ù, why do they want to immigrate here??"
It is also alienating people of this country as well as all other nations that could be compared to haiti. it also demonstrates the feeling of superiority which likely equates in a feeling of superiority not only over a nation but also its population and â€_that kind of peopleâ€œ. And now you can guess what that leads to and why it is bad. another great episode of being a role model for children and teenagers by the US president. But hey at least he says what he thinks...
Dan Provost I just left your fb page and all I can say is please get your tubes tied.... I know you have Medicaid so it won't break your bank... please! last thing we need is for you to procreate .
Rather you did or didn't it doesn't matter it's the truth regardless and we still support you we don't want some pc person in office we want an honest blunt upfront person that speaks his mind like us way to go trump MAGA
"POTUS Donald J. Trump, be you 100% <3   The Libs want you sound mega fancy to confuse the people.  Just call it as it is. We the People get it, and that it's what counts.   Dems Losers!!! move on!!."
"We rainbow white light people are not against You! We are stardust, we are golden...and we've got to get ourselves back to the garden...â_ ï¸èâ¬†ï¸è_Ÿ‘‘â_˜â_˜â_˜_Ÿ’«"
Keep doing your thing and don't give up. Build that wall and clean up that corrupted government. Cannot believe that the Clinton mob is still walking free.
The Donald J. Trump always wins.  Democrats will do anything and everything to make you look bad.  Thank you Mr. President for squaring this away with the truth.
"Regardless of the Words that the President used the reporting of the Washington Post got it right regarding many of these countries. They have major issues! Many of which are due to their corrupt government and their simple ignorance. For example, instead of using birth control many reproduce over and over without the financial means to rear their offspring expecting someone else to pick up the tab like the United States taxpayers. Fact!"
"Many Americans have children they cannot afford and have NO excuse regarding access to birth control here, unlike many third world countries. So.... what are you saying?"

"Still laughing to see the ire of the poor little snowflakes. Oh, did he hurt their ears with an off-color remark?"
"I believe the word you used was ""shithole."" But no, that's not derogatory. Just keep looking in the mirror and repeating ""stable genius stable genius stable genius."""
If the recent announcement of retirements of longtime Republicans is any indication of what is going on there is trouble on the horizon probably much more than we are expecting.  If that is so then they need to resign now because it is their duty to protect the United States from all threats both foreign and Domestic!
"Democrats are just trying to change the narrative ,keep your focus on the true issues by putting Americans and America first"
"I dun't keer what folks think - ef Lavinny's boy looked like his Pa, he wouldn't look like nothin' ye expeck. Ye needn't think the only folks is the folks hereabouts. Lavinny's read some, an' has seed some things the most o' ye only tell abaout.

Let me tell ye suthin - some day yew folks'll hear a child o' Lavinny's a-callin' its father's name on the top o' Sentinel Hill!"
I wonder what else he could say that his base will be able to willingly justify until they realize to what they have fiercely nodded along the whole time.
The democratic party are never going to work with you on anything they only want to bring you down BTW I wouldn't trust most of the Republicans either
Mr. President - you cannot trust the people in those meetings.  I suggest you gather the same people who were in that meeting and go before the camera and ask each and every one of them if you said it.
Ask the Haitian people what they think about Hillary Clinton and all the money she stole from them to rebuild their country
"CRAZY DEMO'S.........my President, they are making it tough for you to survive........I am sure they like t he way the stock market is going..but they seem to want control of out government as well....."
Your derogatory  statements were witnessed. You are the most despicable dishonest LIAR I have ever seen. RESIGN! You are not qualified to represent our great nation!
Lol not even Trump supporters believe he didn't say it. They are ok with him saying it while he is saying he didn't. This is too funny.
"I stand behind you 100% Mr. President and I would not believe anything a Democrat or the mainstream media has to say even if my life depends on it._Ÿ_‚_Ÿ’¨_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸MAGA!"
"Mr. President, say anything you want. To bad for the people could can't take the straight up truth. I argue with someo me  everyday, cause I trust and believe in you."
"Mr President, you are in my prayers every day.  Please  be careful and be safe.  I worry that these swamp creatures will hurt you or even worse.  They don't care what they say so why would they care what they do."
Go President Trump!!   Thank you for telling it like it is.   Praying for the Lord to bless you and protect you as you make our great America great again!!!
Amen!
Keep  speaking the truth! We aren't housing refugees until their countries standards meet or exceed ours! They need to get back to their countries and work on making the change themselves!
"He probably meant iran, Afghanistan,  syria, and iraq. But he most likely didn't say anything remotely close to what the news is saying."

"Only the liberals will spin and twist your every word in the most vile way possible Mr. President, they're out to destroy our Presidency and will stop at nothing to be sure they do, you must be very careful with every word you say, I myself and millions of other great Americans here STAND WITH YOU.... #MakeAmericaGreatAgain"
"But you did though. You called them ""shitholes"" plain and simple and you are not denying it. There is a big gap between you and telling the truth."
"Democrats will pick apart and hate everything you do because they love to hate, love to cause divide. They wake up angry every day it's all part of their daily freak show."
Their experts at flipping the coin. Why cuz most demo are Hollywood actors and actresses.. simple as that..money don't make you smart nor wise.. unless you have goals and dreams like you President Trump. Your doing a fantastic job. Thank you!
"This is the problem with you president Trump, you lack respect, integrity and will most likely lead us to ww3."
WWW3 was supposed to be done by Hillary. Check  it out !.

"Definitely should record future meetings. You could have a whole filing cabinet full of recordings, and call it 'Trumpgate'."
"may be a smart thing to do.. for you and for history.. record , make an archive for the recordings.. every one knows the meeting is being recorded ..."
It is sad that every point that our president trys to make is taken out of context and twisted!  It seems to me that our democratic party wants us to become a 3rd world country!
I am with you Mr. President. Americans first. Build the wall and end chains migration and lottery visa. We can see how Democrats are fighting for illegals in America.
I would just point out that liberal policy lends itself to shithole status. Poor have been voting democrat for50 years and they are still poor. That is until you became president
"Always record! Do not trust people, especially when they have proved in the past they are of poor character.  Helped me out many times on different jobs because I can could take shorthand at 160 WPM.  Have more totally open meetings."
"I believe President Trump and would never, never, never believe or trust Durbin; Durbin, like Satan, has been a liar from the very beginning.  I read about Durbin's fate in the Bible today; you'll find it in Psalms and Proverbs.  I love President Trump; check out my picture!!"
First I heard what they said you said...Then I heard the WAPO heard if from two unnamed people who heard it from someone else...The liberals couldn't tell the truth if their lives depended on it..
"We trust you President Trump and we are certain the lying Democrats ,  just told another lie just like the other lie to back up all the other lies, one more time, adding to the list of millions of bald faced lies."
It's the truth! I'm willing to bet that all these people making a big deal about it would never book their next vacation in any of those places. Why? Because they are shitholes!
Yesterday you said you have wonderful relationship with your Rocket man friend too.  Considering how many lies you said yesterday in various interviews we will have to decide ourselves who is Trustworthy.
So where's the apology from Tricky Dicky Durbin since it turns out you didn't say what he thought you said? Does he have comprehension problems?
"There should ALWAYS be a recording of EVERY meeting. It's the only way to prove just how dishonest the media is, and the only way to expose crooked corrupt politicians."
"According to rolling stone, wapo, buzzfeed, cnn, msnbc etc. etc. thats fake news but its coming out whether they like it or not and then they all have to answer for their complicity in the cover up."
No...you just forget...or try to lie your way out...blame the dems. SHUT UP!!!! Nobody needs to make anything up. You do a good job entertaining on your own.
Like no other politician or person has ised that languge. And he is right we should improve on who we let in our country
"Perhaps you should not have said it in the first place, then you do not have to record them. Remember your voice and comments matter as a leader  not just for the USA, but for the world."
These has time to be silence and take an action to clean up the SwAMP that's causing ALL KINDS of DIVISIONS and OBSTRUCTIONS to make your Administration ineffectively imposible to do Mr. President.
"Right. So now people are lying. Unlike you, who never lies! You donâ€™t have a high IQ, you were never top of your class, and your businesses suck."
I agree that itâ€™s a great idea to record all your meetings DJT. Worked out well for Nixon! Post them in real time so we can all get in on the fun.
Simulcast these meetings on ESPN.
"As Americans, we all strive to live in a nice place. To reside in a neighborhood with tree lined street, open spaces, manicured plush lawns, no/low crime rate, and best schools. For example, in NJ, Chatham or Camden; which zip code would you choose?  Most if not all would choose Chatham, no one wants to live in a sh*thole."
"Did anyone know most of us will be getting to keep more of our paycheck thanks to DJT. Oh, I'm sorry doesn't fit Libs narrative#desist."
"Whether he said it or not, it's not any worse than what the liberals call Alabama, Mississippi and other southern red states!"
just call them third world countries...donâ€™t identify them based solely on whether or not that have plumbing...
The Democrats underestimated our president. They want it all for peanuts. The Democratic party dont care about the dreamers however they only care in trying to make the
"Pardon me, but I feel that any dummy can curse in public, but a truly intelligent individual does not need to resort to cursing. The President's words connoted disrespect for the office which he holds. He talks as if he thinks no one is listening, or if they are listening, they won't repeat what he says. In truth, the world is listening, and everything he says will be repeated. He needs to be smarter than his enemies and think before he speaks. Why does he give his enemies ammunition?"
"Don't care if you did say it, its true!  If those places are so great, why don't people move there by the millions?  Of those people make our country great, why didn't they make their own great?"
"Ever been there? I have. Also abandoned by the Clinton Foundation(Mafia) after the quakes. Why by the way, doesn't anyone speak of that?"
"At least he didnâ€™t raise millions to â€˜helpâ€™ Haitians, only to spend a minute amt to help them, and line his pockets with the majority."
Letâ€™s all start pointing fingers on the democrats telling them that they are the real ennemies of the US and that they are a national security threat!
Until someone who was in the meeting comes forward and says he specifically said those words than it is just more fake news. Definitely should record all meetings in the future.
God knows . You should not wast your time trying to defend your self againt ANGRY people. They are dying to there anger Saten must really be proud of his children
"Wake up people.    Let's be honest and real.   If you live in country where you are eating crickets and sand, and are willing to sell your children to get out. You live in a SHITHOLE country.   Get real."
"Please stop getting on Twitter. Everyday you embarrass this country and yourself before the world. Oh, one more thing. You won the election, please stop talking about Hillary."
"While you are correct, be careful what word you use to describe these countries.  I know what you meant, but you should know how the Dems are just waiting for you to say something that they can use against you."
"That's not the wording they are concerned with. Also Republicans came forward and confirmed it. So the ""Dems made it up"" line, is a blatant lie."
President Trump is gonna need to record every meeting he has for now on because the democrats are out for blood will do or say anything to win in November.
No one claimed you said â€œtake them outâ€ù the claim is you referred to them as a shithole country... and which you also just kind of alluded to _Ÿ__â€çâ™‚ï¸è
And is he lying? They ARE shitholes.
"Record everthing, dems will do and say anything to destroy you and our country.  It will get worse as the truth of their illegal actions are coming to light."
Canâ€™t record all your meetings because some of the real work will not get done yeah not everybody need to know everything move. If the people knew everything they would probably go crazier Then CNN
And why is it such a bad thing to say that if the countries were that great why would all the people try to get out of the country because the country is not good that's why they're trying to come here so when he says s******* it's not that far from the truth is it
We believe you Mr President...and its no lie any 3rd world country is an awful place....but that is nothing of your doing those countries have serious issues and its not our place to take care of them..
"The Post has stated that they used â€œunnamed sourcesâ€ù, who were â€œbriefed on the meetingâ€ù. You do realize that that means the sources they used werenâ€™t even there to hear what the President said, right?"

Democrats blow this out of proportion instead of seeing the truth.  That is their focus.  Pathetic.  As is with every move Trump makes.  Immaturity.
"Love your blunt real speak Mr. President. Keep up the good work! No DACA! If they wanna stay, become a legal citizen. MAGA!"
Use a different trigger word each week. Untill leaker is caught. Plus its funny watching libs implode.
You need to record everything you say when dealing with liars and criminals! Thatâ€™s why Police need body cams and I think that would benefit you as well!
Thatâ€™d be great if government meetings were recorded for full transparency for constituents! What a wonderful suggestion Mr. President. #transparency
So sorry Mr President for the hateful Dem's It will never end. But I and all of the deplorable's  trust in you MORE THAN EVER!!! God give you the strength to keep making America GREAT!!
Liberals and Democrats plus others...... you will never please them!  Don't let it deter you from your job by focusing on them!  We love all that you are accomplishing!
"Say it like it is Mr. President, ""Presidential"" has gotten us in this mess. We want honesty, the only path to resolve, and that is why you are sitting behind that desk."
It hurts the _Ÿ’“ when people lie it is ALSO an abomination to God Bible SAYS so. Maybe that's why God said pray for our enemies (sad ) blessings!!
Here why isn't anyone upset about the millions of dollars raised by fundraising that the Clinton never gave to the Haitians that the America people gave for their crisis !!!!!
Thank you for keeping our country safe for generations to come. The take your words out of context and blurt it out.  Record the conversations so as to guarantee to keep them honest.
We The People Are With You!!  We know who your attackers are!! They twist and scheme just like Lucifer himself.Slippery......Sly and the list goes on......
Doesn't matter what you say or do the media is a 24 hour destroy your presidency spin machine. Keep doing the great things you are doing.
Yes record each and every meeting with a Democrat! They would lie about anything to make themselves look better! I wouldnâ€™t trust one Democratic politician! The only agenda the democrats have is to try to take over and give all the illegals legal access and make them citizens! Americans donâ€™t matter to these shitholes (Democrats)
Trust only your close family with what you say. It is sad to say that there is no more honor or dignity in this country any more. Its all about who you can knock down. Every single word you speak should be recorded so that you absolutely prove you are who you say you are and nobody can put words in your mouth you didn't speak.  And if they try it should be a punishable offence in our countries laws.  NUFF SAID
"Well I wouldnâ€™t care if you did, these countries need to clean up their own backyard and instead they send the US all their worst of the worst and expect us in the US to take care of them. Can you say, WE ARE DONE BEING CHIT ON ! _Ÿ™è_Ÿè»"
We believe you master trump. They can't stand the fact that they lost. We support and love you. You have my family's vote in 2020
"Got to say this. It's funny to me that the media cares a great deal about what Trump may or may not have said about some countries. But never uttered a peep about obummer decimating the whole middle east and the 10's of thousands dead because of his incompetent policies. Hypocrisy, the new vogue in Washington DC."
"Still laughing at the irony in this meme I read:  ""The day that Trump made the left spend 24 hours saying how beautiful and successful the sh*thole countries are, thus negating their argument that illegals can't go home because their home country is a sh*thole""._Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚"
"Immigration should benefit The United States, so the president is correct again.  All this controversy shows is that our president is looking out for our country first."
"Shame on you. You should have said why do we keep getting all these people from thriving paradises! That would have made more sense. Of course if you are living in paradise you would want to leave there and come to America. That's what this is all about, right?"
"You are soooooooooo wrong, i am shanking my head to your comment...you poor thing, you can't see that President Trump is for USA first, SHAME ON YOU."
Sarcasm is lost on you.
"We believe every word you say Mr. President. No matter what evidence the Fake Media ever has, we are your loyal base and you can NEVER disappoint us."
Dear Mr. President Trump... Start handing out pacifiers and Kleenex beforehand!!! It's a reminder for those with overly sensitivity behaviors.
"you know the Dems liars and thief's, its all they have. Everyday one is charged and the media buries it. What a disgrace they are to the American way of life!"
"I love the fact that the most powerful man in the world used the same terminology I use . I say shithole all the time,  must be a new York thing. Those countries are shitholes, it's just a fact!!"
"NEVER FORGET WHAT CLINTON DID TO HATIPresident Trump .... PYA ....because the Democrates ARE out to get you. Recored every meeting ... its the only way to thwart ""the resistance"", they don't care what's true ... they have an agenda impeachment .... what a bunch of zombie converts !"
We are sick of all your lies! Maybe you should just quit and let this country have some respect again! You are pathetic!!!!!

"My. Trump, you donâ€™t need to put every thought of yours on Twitter for the whole world to see! I voted for you but your tweeting is ridiculous! Control yourself please!"
"Obama said almost the same thing about Libia. The President needs to remember anything he says is front page news, there are no closed doors and he can not trust anyone."
"Yes, please do record your meetings, Trump!   I suspect you are the most brilliant leader ever and I'd like to observe you in action."
I still want to know where a recording of this is and not just some source of a source of another source to Washington Post/CNN _Ÿ_”
"Usted siempre es educado y caballero pero las noticias inventan malas noticias dicen mentiras , usted es el mejor presidente que ha tenido Estados Unidos muchas bendiciones a usted Trump y a su familia"

"Sorry Trump but a man in his position should not have this kind of thinking or conduct, every parent has its positives and negatives and is no different with the United States."
So those in the meeting voiced no objections at the time to the salty language but waited to report it to the media afterwards? I know what Iâ€™d say to them next time I met with them.
Its actually refreshing to have a leader that says what the majority is thinking and who doesnt subscribe to the political correctness B.S.
"Mari conforti,   yes Andre berto is a millionaire and  a athletes....I've met him but I'm sure he's a great guy.But some of these people talking how bad we are, all countries have good and bad it's common sense."

"Now others are saying he never said that, of course liberal Dems are all about controlling this country, it's too bad people are that ignorant and are easily influenced.."
The Haitians LOVE Trump who wants to help them and HATE Hilly & Bill-job for screwing them. This leak BS HAS GOT TO STOP. Prosecute the leakers and send a clear message. [[STICKER]]

"WE the People know the truth, President Trump....Just keep up the good work for millions of us who voted for you ....To hell with the democrats and CNN....."
"Tony Schwartz, who ghost-wrote 'The Art Of The Deal' & who hung out with trump for months, warned us about his dishonesty well before the election. Here's a quote from the 7/25/2016 issue of The New Yorker:â€œLying is second nature to him,"" Schwartz said. ""More than anyone else I have ever met, Trump has the ability to convince himself that whatever he is saying at any given moment is true, or sort of true, or at least ought to be true.â€ù"
"This sounds exactly like something you would say, and it's disgusting. Even more disturbing is how many people are supporting the fact that it was done."

". It would be great if law-abiding citizens elected folks who would represent all races of law-abiding citizens within the USA, wouldn't it?"
Your record of hiring and promoting people based on ability not color speaks for you .not like the Dems who just talk and stir up hate.
"CNN says the Washington Post story was based on a single unnamed source, but WaPo now claims ""several"" people heard it.Also of note,  straight from the WaPo story: ""according to several people briefed on the meeting"". In other words, they WEREN'T IN THE MEETING, they were ""briefed"" by others who were.2nd hand info at it's best, folks.."

"Mr Trump, our President Please start recording every thing you say, everyone is sick of news people saying things negective things about you."
How do all of you praise him like a Greek god?  It really is messed up he's done nothing for you and wouldn't if he had the chance how do you do it?
"Nothing? Lets start with the most recent thing, TAX CUTS. Yea, that's ""nothing"" right? Do us all a favor, put on a blindfold and run out onto the highway."

"Mr President I've been a strong supporter of you. Speaking out against Africa including South Africa, calling Africa a s....e is not the impression I've had from you. Referring to the present government, a regime, would say it right but for decades we were a stable and reliable country with wrongs that should have been righted. But South Africa is in no way like the rest of Africa. I've commended you as a person or integrity with backbone to get America back on track. I thing you owe some people in South Africa an apology. Or was that remark about South Africa also fake news. I've said it before. Down grading people is not what you as a President should do. Do the job, be honest and you will be the winner you could be. Don't voice an opinion without being fully enlightend by all the circumstances. What's the difference between religious murders and ethnical murders? Thousands of our precious farmer gave been brutally murdered. Don't call us a s......e country. Reconsider and be objective. Thank you."
President Trump you should do what  is needed to protect your conversations  for the media hears one thing but reconstruct tainted fake newsâù_ï¸è_Ÿ˜ƒâù_ï¸è_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
Unfortunately there are some brain dead people out there still watching the mainstream media. Some in my friends list unfortunately.
"You are too trusting, youâ€™re still naÃ¯ve to trust any opposition into your meetings. Any chance they get they are going to make you look bad"
You don't have to apologize for telling it like it is Mr. President.  Keep protecting our borders and keeping un wanted and illegals out!
"Those places are ""sh*tholes. If not, then those people won't mind going back there....heck....why are they fleeing to the US to begin with?"

"Liberals acting like juveniles to spin everything to the most absurdly obnoxious end for you. Oh, and media outlets eager to run with it.  SSDD."
Mr. President I believe you did call Haiti and Africa shitholes because in fact they are. It's just not politically correct to do it.
Mr. President if I were you I would let the media in on all future meetings so the Democrats can't twist what you say I would keep all these meetings transparent
I knew it was another Democrat lie!! Thank you for addressing all the fake news!! We Love you Mr President!!
If the Haitians were given all the money they were supposed to get from the Clinton foundation theyâ€™d be better off.  Instead Chelsea got the million dollar wedding of her dreams!
"Well, they are S..... holes, He is just saying what many people are thinking. He tells it like it is. He's not the political correct smoocher that Obama was so perfect at."
"Maybe we could teach them how to survive by working, rebuilding, and helping themselves as we do here in America instead of handouts. Don't give them fish _ŸêŸ teach them to fish!"
"Honestly Donald, I believe you because the media has been out to get you since day 1. I still stand with you and will do so again in two years.  Keep it up. maga."
Isn't there always a Friday surprise by the Dems?  There has to be a narative not focusing on the real news.  More Fake News!
"when one of the haitian mayors came here to complain he was not allowed into the white house, obama would not see him neither would hillary, the media said nothing --"
"There has to be hard core numbers on how long refugees stay on public welfare in American. What is the percentage of refugees finding work and getting off public assistance . These are the talking points Americans need to see and process. I'm hoping that refugees come and prosper but I've also heard that the majority come and settle into a life of public welfare. I'd like to see the numbers, not rumors."
"I have never heard the president ever use such language. Someone made this S- - - up ! When he says he didn't do it, you can take that to the bank."
"It just goes to show what kind of people they are,, The Question is why do they want so much power.. The Answer Dems want to take the country down is why"
"Yes, please do record everything. That way we'll always know for sure. And if you dont share records then we know you're lying. Perfect plan, great idea. Let's do it."
I have no doubt what you say is true President Trump!!  It doesn't sound like you. It sounds more like the way the Dems celebrities and the media naturally talk.
"It is poor,  but why after 8 years of presidency in USA,  Clinton went to Haiti and buy all these land over there?"
"Out of 13 BILLION donated the Clintons took the lion share of 10 billion, not million but BILLION and rotten Hillarys brother received all the gold mining rights. Arkansas has impaneled a Grand Jury and subpoenas into the Clinton foundation pay for play. Here we go !! #MAGA"
The democrats are going to do whatever it takes to take away from the progress that has been made and the efforts that have been put forth to clean up the mess that Obama had made of our country!!
"The Dummycrats are chronic Liars. They're hateful and hypocritical and almost everything they accuse the other side of are all things they alone are guilty of."
I agree President Trump. You need to privately record every thing that comes out of your mouth. You just can't trust anyone in that White House.
"Well we all know we can certainly trust the democrats to tell the truth, and not lie, just like their Dossier is so truthful, right?  yep, that swamp sure is a cesspool"
"Then those Dems need to be called out, as these type of lying tactics are unbecoming of those elected to serve in public office. We the People!"
Thank GOD for President Trump. How could ANY REASONABLE person believe ANYTHING that the mainstream media says about our President. #FAKENEWS and corruption = liberal party/media.
"Mr. President, please record all your meetings for your protection. Then put them up on your WH channel for us to see."
So sad that they will keep throwing crap at you to see how much of it sticks.  They are absolute fifth and will stop at nothing to blemish your good name. Obviously!!
"Well, when on of their main religions is Santaria; a voodoo religion that idolizes both the Devil and Christ (lots of statues and candles); one can not be too surprized!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Since we are talking about MAGA, what theHELL happened to SSA? 9 bucks is NOT 2%. Regulate Medicrap so they don't eat it all for the THIRD straight year. [[STICKER]]"
Acute Trump Derangement Syndrome (commonly referred to as ATDS) has completely taken over the Democratic Party. Obsess about the semantics of what Trump may or may not have said is what the libtards care about. Sick puppies who need to see a vet.
Keep up the good work sir. No need to explain yourself to me. You must have a very small circle now but please know that you are doing an awesome job.
"Mr. President Donald J. Trump you were stating FACT, people need tougher skin that get ""OFFENDED"" at least little things. like oprah can't stick to a diet, how could she run a super power country?"
Yes.  Reinstall the sign in books at the white house and if you are using your private properties for the countries business do the same there.  Please record all conversations and then listen to yourself.  Only through self-awareness will you have the ability to change.
We are the deplorables. We are not politically correct. We call it like we see it. There are shithole countries and there are plenty more like them. Unfortunately he only named a few...lol
"He did not say it but I will ... it is a SHITHOLE !!!!  Haiti is a SHITHOLE !!  There you go ... said it twice.Why democrats have so much trouble calling things for what they are?  Can't sugar-coat everything!!"
No one should blame someone else for speaking the truth about these countries. If anyone is to blame it's THEIR leaders/government for not taking better care of their citizens.
"Detroit and Cleveland have been upgraded to ""armpit"". After 50 plus years of democratic rule, it is going to take years to get them above ""stank breath""."
The Media is really unhinged Itâ€™s embarrassing how they report their opinions and not the Whole Truth
"So tired of the he said she said. Bipartisan war needs to end and everyone needs to talk less, and logically act more. Working together is sadly too idealistic."
"The Haitians sur have a Major Beef with the Clin-Toons? All of the Millions they Raked In, and next to nothing expended from their ""Foundation""?"
"Stay the course, Donald Trump and ignore those that try to put you down. As mentioned earlier, you are in a great position to do a lot of good for America!"
"You talk as if America is heaven...a country where shooting and killing is the order of the day...Quit over valuing your country, we all got challenges"
If Trump says a thousand words and one word is not exactly the word the liberals choose him to use it is plucked out and used to try and bring him down.
I'm enjoying watching all the women tell how well they're doing since they came here from those places. Just the other day the Democrats had us believing that women didn't have things in this country that women weren't capable of things in this country that women were an allowed to do things boy look at all the things they said they've accomplished in America
"Maybe he isn't politically correct, maybe he says things that to some are offensive. ..We All have at some point ..I'm not worried about that .bigger fish to fry."
"Just apologize, Donald J. Trump.  Give them what they need to hear.  I curse like a Sailor...it's JUST a bad habit....but really 'cuts to the chase'!  #POTUS"
"Pam HargesheimerNope. OB did by funding terrorists, releasing felons, not protecting our borders, and bowing down. Lying didn't help either. Shameful."
"Sometimes, the truth hurts.  The libs just can't stand to hear it.  Keep on speaking the truth, no matter who it offends.  The majority of America has your back!"
Yes please record future meetings!!!!!!! This will clear up things all around and allow the people to actually be a part of these discussions. This is a great idea!
"As much as I like Trump, Calling other countries or continents shitholes is unpresidential.  Could have been worded a little better lol."
In my opinion they had a pretty good meeting yesterday and all they took away from that was he said shithole about another country. Which it probably is a shithole
the truth will stand when the worlds on fire.  more Americans need to stand for the truth.. no the dems got everything too sugar coated.
GOD BLESS MR PRESIDENT...
"Yet still no answer to the question he posed! The very same question that the majority of hard working real Americans are asking every day, just (maybe) not with the same adjectives!"
They had to do something after the great reaction you got on Tusedays meeting and letting the People into your office.  very sad!!!!  Keep up the good work!
"He has the best relationship with Haitians, better than anyone else, he knows the biggest and the best Haitians and all the great ones. Haitians think he is great. Fake news, sad _Ÿ˜„_Ÿ˜„"

By now the whole effin' world knows what kind of low life scumbag (also know as a used condom) you are DJT.  Start packing your bags for your move to Russia.
You Can Keep Your Own Doctor!!! How come all you snowflakes aren't melted completely over this lie? Half & Half was a God & everything he/she said was the gospel!
"You are doing great, President Donald Trump!  The mature, educated and productive majority of Americans are with you 100%!"
Don't back up - it is what it is.  We elected you because we were tired of the bs.  Don't let them put you in a defensive position - it never ends well.
Yeah and if he tells you an apple is Orange you people belive whatever he says. Bunch of puppet is what see here. Your white hope president won't there much longer.
"For our protection against the trouble making Democrats, you should record the meetings so when they wake up in a new world we can play it back for them."
Why did Durbin feel so compelled to bring this to the media.  No wonder our nation is still being divided! Keep that kind of stuff in-house.
Democrats are heading for another HUMILIATING defeat in 2018......who will be blamed this time? Rocket man?
"Time to record everything around any dems. Their two headed snakes just waiting to attack. So please cover your back. And WE THE PEOPLE STAND BY YOU ,100%. ALWAYS !"
"So little do the DEMS. get it ?? But this world is an awsome place,  but their self pitty B.S. Is Takening over the norm of life. MR TRUMP,Start letting them know WINING TIME Is UP. Thank YOU!!!"
He has to learn that they will lie and frabricate anything to destroy him.  He must install and on demand recording system and put it to use!
"Just remember sir, if THEY have no proof, it's just hear say. Besides, truth is painful to hear. We all know it. Let them cry over it. Truth is still truth."
"Don't worry Mr. President. You're faithful Movement still stands with you 100%.We all knew what you meant. Record everything for all the crybabies."
"Tape the meeting. Does not mean you have to broadcast it, just tape it so the Fake News and snowflakes can whine over something else."
"Thank you Mr. President, you are doing a great great job! God put you the White House to get this Country on the right track! God bless!"
"Except you are a big, big, BIG liar. The biggest. And you are the only one denying you said this."

Laurie Gonzales-Shelton - agreed. Trump is a snowflake. Even lying about the reason he isn't coming to the UK next month AND lying about the history of the embassy move as well as part of that. All because he knows he'll be showered in piss if he comes here - and not the sort he likes.
You on drugs dude?

"Andrew Hards That's just like a lazy Liberal, deflect from your culpability and try to reflect it on a hard working man."
He has certainly worked hard on his golf game. I grant you that.
Trump supporter tip of the day:  1)ignore them -their only goal is to spread hate.  2)BLOCK gets rid of the dregs.
Golf game libs got nothing so they attack someone playn golf? As much good as he's doing no one would care if he played golf everyday...well except libs
"What 'good' is he doing? I'm all ears.P. S. Remind me again who constantly tweeted about Obama playing golf and said 'If I'm elected POTUS I won't have time for golf'?"
Mr. President you should record everything. The dems are out to take you down anyway they can! So dishonest
"You are so right. Dems are always grasping at straws. If they spent as much time.being part of the solution instead of the problem, just imagine!"
"Copied and edited by me.  I feel it speaks volumes.I personally don't believe in or use foul language normally or casually. Even if provoked, it would take an extreme situation for me to use cuss words out aloud. Those that know me can vouch for this. However,  people are different. Many good hearted people I know do use words such as this. I think one should be less sensitive to terms like ""sh**hole"" and understand what is meant in context.'Sh**holes' or  'Hellholes'. Have seen parts of the USA that are like that. It is just that in some countries it is predominant. Waiting to jump on any word Trump or anyone considered politically an adversary reflects more on us than  Trump. There have been truly more horrendous obscenities perpetrated in the name of the American or supposedly advanced civilised nations by smooth talking,  well presented, self-righteous politicians for a long, long time. So much so that Trump's proclaimed policy of worrying about and focusing on USA first is a giant leap forward morally - less interference and meddling around the world. He should be lauded for that. The problems of countries like Haiti have been too much corruption among leaders who worked with the well groomed smooth glib talking leaders from the USA for many decades - they siphon all the money that should have gone to clean up the streets and provide water and toilets. India is also a great example of that. Let us get more sensitive to policies and actions of Presidents and leaders and less sensitive to words  - both foul sounding and wonderful soothing ones.   #MAGA"
So now we are supposed to believe these third world crap holes are not crap holes...they are and forever will be until the corrupt governments are removed.....liberals ate truly nuts
Wow! You people need help. How are you so sensitive that you find this statement so offensive? How are you existing in this world being that soft??? Holy crap put your big girl panties on.
Democrats and deep state have been trying to turn the US into a s**t hole for years. Thank God we found a great President who is working night and day to end the corruption and making America the wonderful place it once was. It's going to take a long time to undo every horrific thing they have done to destroy our country and taking us down with it. 7 more years for our wonderful President and then we must vote in the next that President Trump endorses.
"We all know that MR President, this is just an effort by dems to distract us. They never talk about your acomplishments, they rather want distract people with this nonsense. They are so desperate_Ÿ˜‚"
"What you say in private should be respected, period. So it is not what you say; but what people say that you said.... Why let that bother you? Consider the source and keep up the good work."
Everybody is in a dither about what you said but I've heard these same politicians call these country's cesspools. Can anyone tell me another word for cesspool?....
"â€ªAmerica is the last hope for civilization for mankind; if it fails, it would mark the end of the world as we know it. Succeeding however, requires the co-existence of people of all races and cultures living in harmony, respect and peace with each other. The choice is ours.â€¬"
Americans will Unite and take back the country together. The power is in all the American people not in the zionists and marxists whom want to destabilize it from within. Keep speaking the truth and continue to organize and unite to take back the country. Do it for woman equalities and rights!!!!
The Libs are just pissed because he is attempting to stop the gravy train(free money train) that they have created! That's why they lie and attack him every chance they get!
"And now Hillary has the nerve to say something about  what our President was accused of saying What  is worse a few words or murder , or supporting a rapiest"
face book tried to keep me from saying this. Just like the news said they were doing to conservative views.

"I wouldnt trust any of them, pubes nor dums, ans especially the press....we elected YOU, not the conservative pubes..you rock..backstabberz not somuch"
Ps..haiti IS A shithole..reason they are coming here. Ps..still think we should pack off the u.n. to haiti..and turn thay tower into productive condos
Unfortunately these days proof of everything is necessary. Even with proof the crazies will find some way to turn it around to help out their own agenda.
"Yes  Mr.Trump remember who your dealing with , record everything .wonder how many will use their big mouths to apologize when things come together as you plan."
The liberal crybabies don't understand. And absolutely none of them have a wish to spend their vacation time in these fourth world nations.
I would like to personally thank all  the Democrats. Without them I would not be such a big fan of the Trump Whitehouse. (Psst. I used to be a Democrat up until last year.)
"Who  cares what the liberals and fake media think. Keep up the good work. If they canâ€™t support themselves,send them back. We have enough free loaders as it is."
Americans. Republican and democrats third party. Should never be vindictive at time like this. The people lost everything. It could happen to all of us.
"Get your facts right. People will say anything about anyone except the person causing the problems. That person is Trump,not Clinton."
You're a great man...Even if you didn't say that...African people should take it as an advice....So they have to developp their country....
That's why we love you & voted for you:  you say what the rest of us are thinking.  The left and their PC-ness curtailed our speech.  Call a spade a fecking shovel!
"Dems stay making stuff up, we know Mr. President. Sorry you had to be the only President in history subjected to this much hostility and hatred. Support you till the end!"
"Of all the people present at the Meeting. Only two Lib Turds heard A bad word. Now that is amazing, And both of them are noted liars."
"That's not what we're talking about mr. President we're talking about s*** hole countriesSo your statement doesn't make any sense!Frankly we were hoping you did say it because we're sick of people talking about illegal immigration being an act of loveAnd how wonderful third world people are if they were so wonderful why are there country s*** holesWe're all so sick of people talking about DACA and Steve being a bill of loveGet it!Straighten up mr. President or we're going to have to fire you in 2020 get back to tough tough tough immigration and deporting all illegals in accordance with our laws like you promised"
I'm starting to think that you really do have some kind of mental problem. I mean really do you have no self-control.

"If you did say it (and I am sure if you did someone will come up with a ""secret"" recording of it)...at least own it.  It's nothing that hasn't been said before."
Yes! Bring in the media announced on more congressional meetings so they can show their true divisive tendencies! Does nothing but helps the GOP
True that's why they called it shitholes! Democrats have NO brain because till now can't get over it their big time LOSER the last election.
"People call areas of our country shitholes....get upset about that!  Finally, a President that isn't a politician!  Tell it like it is President Trump!!"
Who cares if he did...it was a closed meeting not a public address and the statement is factually correct.  We know it to be true.  Why not prioritize those people that can add value immediately over those that will become immediate welfare anchors....
Be of good cheer sir.....they wouldn't attack you if you were one of them!!! And you are not!!! And that is a good thing.  We love you....KEEP ON TRUMPIN'!!!!!
"We know what you meant...and I agree. Norway claims 98% of crimes are done by foreigners. That's just a fact,just like Haiti is a dirt poor country and nothing changes.

If he'd just think of America as a Brand with himself being the chief spokesman for it maybe he'd temper his speech a little bit.
America's brand is not the Israeli brand.
Good job mr president. Thank you for speaking the TRUTH. Snowflakes donâ€™t like hearing it. Kinda like when they lost and we got the best president America has ever had
Yes....show all meetings and negotiations.  Keep liberals honest.  Accountability is how you shut up their socialist narrative they try to hide.
"â€œLook, did the president say shithole or shithouse? Does it even matter?â€ù Noah continued. â€œHim having a poo-poo mouth isnâ€™t the story for me.

"We have a poisonous president, but it will be up to republicans and Trump supporters to make him go. Wake up folks, our country is in trouble."
"THANK YOU, President Trump! I am sure you would never have said that! Now, I think you probably did say sh**h*** countries--and for that, I say you are simply telling the truth! There are demands that you apologize. I say, never give in--lol--never, never never--lol! I am sick of everyone having to tiptoe around all of the time so that we don't hurt anyone's little feelings! We need to tell the truth, and of course be kind and helpful about it, but we need to stand strong for truth. I make it my own policy not to say curse words. If I did, I'd plaster just what you said all over, because it is true. And because people will actually know it, then something could be done to really help those countries. The media is the same way--they are what-you-said journalists now. It needs to change. THEY need to apologize, not you! I know you are a man, humbling yourself before God, and obviously doing the best job possible. Thank you, again."

President Trump absolutely needs to record these meetings. He needs to protect himself & prove to the world who the liars are. _Ÿ˜¡
"Yes from now on record all future meetings so the ""D"" can't tell a lie on you. They are really good at telling lies. God Bless you Mr. President Trump!!!"
"You have that right Mr. President, tape those meetings, and learn that you can not trust anyone, not even some of the very ones you trust.  Hard lesson to learn..."
Please do. Start recording every meeting. We have all seen they will lie to make you look bad if they can and misconstrue anything you say.
"I am disappointed in Mia Love, spouting before getting the facts. Goes to show that Republicans cannot stick together when the going gets tough. Very sad!"
You got a lot of people out there that just want to cause problems for other people never trying to help nobody they just want to cause problems for other people and mr. Trump has got his full plate of troublemakers
Keep your eye on the prizes President Trump. We need infrastructure and so much more. Don't waist your time back-tracking.
So agree.
"I'm on social security and retired from Ford Mo, with a mortgage and getting a really nice refund.  If my nice refund goes away, I won't be voting republican again.  I voted for Trump to help me, not screw me over!!!!"
"I don't know if President Trump said it or not.  I do know if it was said, it was against the country, not the people.  If this does not apply to the country, why are they all wanting to come here?"
Record everything. They are out to get you. Ever since i did this. They cant accept responsibility and ive got control of.my.life again.
"That's right Donnie, everyone is out to get you and everyone is crazy except for you. You need to be committed. #notfitforoffice"
Everything you say should probably be recorded so it could be played back to you 5 minutes later when you forget you said it.
"The rotten Democratic party is really showing their ugly, ugly colors.It seems like the party of liars and criminals.  Who knew???Shame on them."
Wtf are you smoking lady? The party of criminals? Are you aware of the investigation into the White House and the indictments handed down already? I canâ€™t with you guys....
You owe us explanation or apology Mr.Trump.Its alleged that you also used derogatory words referring to some African experts in your country!
Hey if they weren't shitholes then we wouldn't have a problem. Don't apologize for not being politically correct.
"That's exactly how I interpreted your truthful words, it's the corrupt leaders that build, sustain and maintain the shithole countries."
If a democrat says PRESIDENT Trump made offensive derogrative remarks it's a pretty sure bet the democrat lied!!!!! That's what democrats do - LIE.
I was quite offended at being called a deplorable by a candidate for President. Apparently that was ok....
We Know you didn't mean the People Mr. President - Who Happen to be coming to America to better their lives because Haiti is a S**thole - We all know that. Everyone Knows That. You Just have the Guts to say it out loud <3
"Recording your meetings may be a necessity, Mr. President. Unfortunately, we live in a time where nobody respects anyone. Nobody gives you the respect you deserve."
They should look into the Clinton foundations activities there!
Maybe you should educate yourself and pick up a book to actually know what you're talking about.
I did!  Thats how I know they scammed them.  Go back to your moms basement!
zionist Clinton investigated her Jewish roots. Her daughter is married to George Soros Schwartz's nephew they got married in Israel
Clinton bought and paid for attorney general Eric Holder he's bought and paid for doj Loretta Lynch she's bought and paid for Cohen FBI director he's bought and paid for Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer bought and paid for
"Donald calculate the % Haitians and African countries made up in your ARM FORCES. Just think before you make any other statement on Haitians and African countries. Seriously! Be very careful.You're a tangible shame."
"Agreed, going to have to record all meetings, gives the dems/libs no room to twist turn spew when its recorded..........sad it has evolved to this, but thats their MO"
I would record meetings to president Trump. ..specially with the media and democrats  that always makes something out of nothing. ..
"Don't opologize for simply Telling The Truth! For every individual acting as if they're offended, there are 10 others who support you."
And those acting offended likely act much worse when they're not acting like martyrs on social media.
"â€ùshithole countriesâ€ù! Yeah, that's the way to treat other countries. Why keep any friends at all. After all, US is the greatest and don't need anybody else.You can't be used to success when thinking."
Their new twist on your words is you only want blonde hair blue eyed people to immigrate to the US. Please be careful with your words. They will twist them to meet their own agenda. Not sure how they came to that conclusion but it is not surprising to me.
"Check out where all the funds that the Clinton Foundation collected for that country, they put in a good show, but where did that money go?"
"Yes, it is much, much better to pretend you have done so much for Haiti while lining your personal pockets. I will buy in to all the ""compassion"" when they actually are willing to sacrifice on behalf of others. It is easy to say write another big check on borrowed money that others will have to pay back. Here is my idea. It is tax time. Let's put a check-off on the tax form for people to check with an amount they are willing to donate to pay for immigration-but it must come from their personal refund. Then that part of everyone's taxes must be public record. In addition, let's pass a law whereby federal lawmakers can donate a percentage of their personal salary to the cause and that will also be made public.We need a new emphasis on learning regarding the obligations of government versus charity. Big time."
"Rien Ã  foutre que tu comprennes franÃ§ais oÃ_ pas mais je vais quand mÃªme le dire!la merde dans cette histoire c'est toi! moi j'espÃ¨re juste que tu apuis sur le nuclÃ©aire direction la corÃ©e ou la russie, Ã§a compte peu, et bingo...25Ã¨me amandement!!!"
"Sure, weâ€™ll believe anything you say. If you record meetings all you would say is â€œthat isnâ€™t my real smart voice you hear â€œ and expect everybody to believe it. You are the pure idea of â€œFake Newsâ€ù."
"Democratic are still licking their wounds.I believe he meant ""Why don't we focus on relations w richer countries to help our deficit.""  He is about money and that's why we like him. Pray for him and our country like the Bible instructed. He has our lives in his hands."
they are shitholes and dems want to make our country into a third world shithole...BUILD THE WALL...NO AMNESTY...
Remember where your shithole ancestry came from. ...

"Don't even talk to the Democrats, they have made it clear they are at war with the president and slandering him. We do not negotiate with terrorists."
He slanders himself. He needs no help with that.
Need to record mtgs selectively so that no one ever knows which really were recorded.....then MAYBE the truth will prevail when these people can be caught in their lies
How many times does he have to be burned before he learns.  There is no ONE America.  Dems and some Repubs. Just want to perpetuate their time at the taxpayers trough
Some journalists (conservatives) reported that he said shithouse instead of shithole. Maybe in his mind that's not as derogatory a term???
Trump! You better humble yourself because 3years from now when youâ€™re out of that office you better pray that you have the strength to handle whatâ€™s coming for you!!! #HumbleYourself
"If he had said it, don't you think every democrat in that meeting would have ran to the nearest camera to spout off about what he said?!?"
"So now Pinocchio tries to lie his way out of saying what he said to a roomful of witnesses. Sad, but typical for this bald-faced lying bully."
"Sad I'm thankful you didn't say that . As all their trying to do is get youIn trouble . Yes tapeWhat you say . I'm so proud your our president .  Keep up theGoodWork ."

I've been to Hati it is a shithole because of its corrupted goverment the majority of the people are I'm sure would love to come to the USA at least thats what they said to me_Ÿ˜_
"I mean it depends on how you take it. You could be sensative and cry about it or you could say ""oh well"" and move on. I could care less what he calls other countries. As long as he stays with his agenda and keeps doing good for Americans. Although do some research about his statement as to where he said it, what meeting he was in when he said it, and use context clues to understand what he actually meant. Again, a lot of people are just blowing things out of proportion."
"I am thoroughly disgusted with you. So many wasted their votes on you not knowing fully what kind of human being you are...but are now showing the world! Even worse are the comments I see here still supporting you after so many terrible things are true about you. You still have idiots trying to distract from your vile acts by bringing out the Hillary card again....and again..and again. History is already judging you as well as the ""supporters"" who you are still fooling! Shame on you and those that fail to condemn your actions."
"Dear President, we do read between the lines when people obviously twist your words. Your actions and words prove your good intent even though misinterpreted. So, so many people support you as POTUS."
With due respect Mr President i sometimes wonder how you reason. I'm African and proud of where you referred to as 'shithole' because it made me stronger and tougher. It made me who i am 'Human'. You should be one too cause it appears that you are an alien from an unknown Planet. #We Rock!!
"Standing with our President! The Liberals will do anything to take him downâ€”-especially lying about anything.  He is totally under a microscope, and  they will use anything to discredit him.  God is in control, least anyone forget!"
"what is not derogatory about calling other states shitholes? â€_poor and troubledâ€˜ are words of a president, â€_shitholesâ€˜ is not. using such words is not cool. thats what my parents told me. but maybe thats different in the US."
"Minka Bourelly, in polite society, I agree there are better words to be used, Our government has become so concerned about offending people with words the truth of situations are not understood. I'm sure it courses difficulty for some to accept plain direct honest statements about the truth. It gives little room for honest people to try and wiggle around. I think we need more direct straight forward words and statements from our people in government."
"i could not disagree more. there is no excuse for being impolite and dishonest. if you call other countries shitholes, bad enough, but be it. but trying to make us believe shitholes was not meant in a derogatory way... come on. thats poor."
It has become obvious that DJT said something incredibly un-PC.  I wish he would issue a sincere apology to those who were/are offended and do it in the WH Press briefing. Don't try to justify it.  Just apologize.  Tweets on Twitter are for TWITS - both the writers and the followers are mostly twitterpated  Just stop it! [[STICKER]]
Oh how these tossers just never give up on trying to bring Trump down. My god we have some morons in this world. Roll on Trumpy!!!
"Oh my, this Is the worst thing I've ever heard today. What was not reported was an answer to the question the President asked. Was there an answer?"
C-SPAN for all non-classified meetings.  You do well in those settings and it really changes the narative away from the accuations to the actual footage.
"POTUS is a pathological liar, millions are supportive of the lies and the underlying hatred and bigotry behind the lies. #MAGAMYASS"
Probably should record your meetings. Either to recall things you have said or to use as proof of libtard lies against you..
Forge ahead. Lots of places in the world and here in the states are s##tholes. I'm in and out of them on a regular basis
I would suggest you record from now on.  Hang in there Mr President. Thank u for all youâ€™re doing. Iâ€™m so tired of all the lies. We love you
I remember back when a hurricane or muddslide   donation collection was supose to help Hati and it went into Hillary's pocket book.
"That's what happens when you have to deal with the dirty democrats, they will never be fair and they'll go to any extreme to take You down."
"you are only racists who take the pleasure of humiliating the haitians because of their color, one day you will regret it"
"Mr President, you have the guts to say what many will not say openly but secretly think. I think you should record all of you meetings. And you're telling the truth. It's the LEADERS of these countries that turned them to that condition"
I believe you Donald! If you say you didn't then you didn't. They make up lies all the time why should this be any different._Ÿ˜˜
Stop with the drama and defending yourself for everything people say about you.  Ignore what the dems say/do and you will be a lot better off.
why are they all trying to sabotage this?   Parts of the deal were brilliant.  Give him a little more wall and let's call it a day.
After what the Clintons did w/ the relief money and humane trafficking I would think the Dems would keep their big mouths shut
Thank you God for President Trump. He is working hard for the American people and the American way of life. We are blessed.
Yes we are Lois
get the money back from the Clintons that they stole from the Haitians so they can afford to clean up their cesspool mess.  And put the Clintons in prison while you're at it!!
You are correct sir these aren't paradise countries whatsoever but Mr President tread lightly anytime you speak to a democrat they are out to get you and will make up lies about you to stall our movement but we are still with you sir
Please record everything you pioneering reality tv star...letâ€™s get a bipartisan recording crew in there and go for it...no denying a live feed
"Find your leak, Mr. President. Don't allow them back into any meetings. Knowing the libs, they'll move on to something else. They are like the weather."

It is scary how they love to pit us all against each other instead of working to better America.  They rather make sure no feelings are hurt.  UGH
Televise all future meetings.  If that's what it takes to keep libs honest...it'll just secure a 2020 win.
A win for Democrats
"Sorry, no.Even msnbc was praising him for that televised meeting."
"Holly,  are you kidding me MSNBC can hardly stomach him!  Catch up! You are DELUSIONAL!"
"Maryanne, go away."
"Itâ€™s amazing how Donald Trumps words seem to be taken out of content and given so much air space, I agree with your suggestion ....  but even if you record they would tamper with it!!!"
Just dawned on me this story is out just before MLK holiday on Monday. I wonder what other #FakeNews stories are slated to come out before Presidentâ€™s Day next month?
It was a misunderstanding - i am sure you will show how much you really love the Haitian people by coming up with the best most fair immigration bill ever : )
"They will always take what you say and turn it into something else. Ignore them. But on the other hand, it does keep them busy. So easy to sideline them. Could be a good thing. They bite st anything and everything ! _Ÿ˜†"
"No worries Mr President. We have s*** holes in California already. Actually, s*** holes in DC too. Sometimes â€œthe Truthâ€ù hurts. Grow up Democrats and #maga #conservativesget2work"
Well Casey do you have proof Clinton's gave the money?? You fool it's well noted by anyone with any brains.guess that leaves you out.
the countries ARE $h!&holes run by dictators and criminals that line their pockets at the expense of their people .... like the D.C swamp.THE TRUTH IS HARSH.
That would be the best thing. They would hate it because they could NEVER change anything said during those meetings. DEMS WILL MELT FAST.
"Sad to say, it may be time to openly tape all meetings. Set that recorder right in the middle of the table at the meetings. Then see what gets said."
"Find the leak, Sir. Keep going. Us non liberals arent falling for it. We got your back! The flu isn't an epidemic...liberalism is!"
Media savages! And people are seeing and starting to realize it. POTUS did nothing wrong. Look back at Nixon and LBJ said. Them two cuss like sailors...
"And what happened to Nixon, fool?"
"Vulgar yes, but he was still a good president. Go suck down some more martinis pig!"
This guy gets dumber every passing day.  I wonder when some one is gonna silence him forever and save this planet.!!!
"Durban says it  â€” I do not believe it.  Democrats always trying to stir up divisivness using color, gender, country, etc."
"You are right James, I saw a documentary on Haitians protesting outside the CLINTON fOUNDATION BECAUSE ALL THEY DID WAS BUILD A BIG WAREHOUSE. Ad after ad after ad of them saying just send any amount you can, even $1 will help>>>>>"
Most be likely lie made up by the liberal haters who go out of their way to hurt this country and it's people. Instead of doing their job they want to sit on their hands and obstruct progress.
Where did all the money go that suppose to go to Hati after that haircare a few years ago? Porta Rico a while back. All the billions they can't account for
Face it folks...a sh*thole is a sh*thole and should be able to be called for what it is.  Meetings including the presence of Dems should be recorded.
"Never be silenced by democrats!  Keep up telling the truth!  Haiti was screwed royally by the Clinton Foundation, essentially robbed.  Thanks for bringing light to it being the hell hole it is, even if Democrats mischaracterized your statement, as expected."
take responsibility for what you say and do you POS and do the honorable thing if you have a shred of honor left in you and resign for the good of the country.
the fake news is in overdrive.....keep going Trump... its the best reality show on earth...hilarious....even the UN  are repeating these fake reports...lmao
Backup all your conversation then the left and there BS which they do can be called out!!   Turn the Tables which you do already!
Yep you need to put that recorder right out there and look at each Dem and smile and then say let's get this party started!
"True please record every meetings with both the republicans and democrats.That would keep things in check.Never trust anybody except God,Mr President"
"The President did not use that language, he was behind closed doors, someone who didnâ€™t like it because the President didnâ€™t like their deal leaked false statement!"
He's the most honest business man. Especially because he's a honest casino owner!!  Those who don't like it!! Get out of this country!!!
So many cry babies and not enough tissue. Let me guess they all also have fool proof plans on how to win millions at the blackjack table also.
"At a casino, the people are the real winners!  I mean people actually get tired of winning.  Just read the papers.  I mean what if you have a daughter one day and can't find a job.  I mean, he also owns major Strip clubs that would help her with employment!"
Not to mention strip clubs are great for the economy!
"Lol, yeah. Casinos and strip clubs are the real economy boosters. I'm excited for my future daughter."
Mr.Trump we all know the fake news out there does there best to turn people against you but it will not work in Jesus name! Keep on keeping on Sir:) Thank you
"President Trump, I am a big fan of yours, but I am disappointed that you, as a Christian, used foul language... makes me doubt whether you really are a Christian."
Yes record the meetings. All of these leaks and lack of respect to keep conversations private during closed door meetings are distracting you from getting things done.
"We, the silent majority are with you 100 percent Mr. President. You are right on target. Carry on, Sir! You are doing a great job! _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‘ç_Ÿè»_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸"
Please do as the dumacrats can't remember anything and even if they thought they remembered they would twist it around. Lol at them lol
"oh my virgin ears, so what if you said 'shitholes', some of those countries are shitholes, hell, we have cities here that are shitholes."
That's right.  Clintons built the New factory way on the other side of where hatians lost their homes.  Didn't help any of them.
"Like the way you said it, Mr. President, like a working man/women would say it, like a military man would say it. Only D.C. and news people are pretend offended!"
"""take them out"" wasn't the part that was offensive, I believe that was the ""sh**hole"" part.  It's OK, no sane person believes anything you say anymore anyway."
"Sir President, always is time to learn something new, a close meeting with politician is not equal a close meeting in the private sector.  Politician are hienas waiting for the prey to desmember it, next time bring somebody to record the meeting.  After all this attack on you  have ice bag effect, today you can drink   could, tomorrow the ice become hot waters. Keep MAGA.!!"
Sad that they lie and distort everything..... and the sheeple of the dimocraps will believe anything cnn and other lamestream media tells them to believe !!!
Rescued hatiians fleeing the shithole.  They are confused with easter they celebrate good Friday. ..could have something to do with not Resurrecting.
"Some people you can joke with. That was told to me one time,lol,lol. You will ruffle some feather's. A closed meeting is a closed meeting."
"God bless you for telling it like it is whatever you said.the Democrats twist everything you say and do, karma will come around."
"I never received my requested Christmas card from you--NOT counting Obama...I received cards from the Reagans on! (And, I did all that work on your campaign!)"
"Those trolls never stop, do they?? I think itâ€™s a great idea to record meetings or anything you do anywhere near one of them"
"I thought Bill n Hil had taken care of them with all that money they collected... on wait, they just kept it _Ÿ_”"
Why are the Dems such liars??!!! I have to say that I am glad to see who they really are. I pray the rest of America does too.
President Trump.....You cannot trust anyone anymore......Record all your meetings with everyone.....No matter who they are or what party or foreign country.....
"He says what everyone is thinking in their mind. I don't care what wording he uses. He is getting a job done, and doing it very well."
"News media just needs another narrative you should know that by now ..Before you knowIt this one will dwindle away and another will start"
No matter what gets done people are gonna complain. From what I've learned in life that means you are usually doing the right thing. MAGA!!!
Record everything. Too many back stabbers in the meetings. And people are fast to rush to judgment  when they werenâ€™t even in the meeting
Working at COD I learned real fast to record all meetings and conversations!  I would advise POTUS to do the same!
"You're right! No one trusts you. Probably because you're a liar. But that's nothing new, all politicians are liars. The two words are practically synonymous."
Trump is not a politician fool.
"He's president... That makes him a politician by definition. Mike Timberlake, think before you type. You just made your stupidity public record."
I personally think any meeting Trump has should be secretly recorded. He does great things when he doesnâ€™t know heâ€™s being recorded!
"This morning Trump tweeted something incorrect about Obama, specifically his role in moving the London embassy. It has been pointed out that Bush moved the embassy. Can you Trump supporters acknowledge he was wrong? Can Obama now sue under Trump's suggest tougher libel laws?"
you just keep up the good work and ignore those who are so negative and make up things about you. God Bless America and thanks for putting americans first!!!
"Very sad when they have to twist words to benefit them. Not one of them has mentioned the new tax reform bill, u Ummm? Keep up the good work Mr. President"
If you called them what they say then you should just say youâ€™re sorry. Thatâ€™s how they roll in that town. Sorry makes everything better? To politicians that is.
"We need to vote the Dems out, that will take care of those crazy people, the Dems childish people that can't seem to grow up. When will they ever stop, lieing about our president. I am so sick of it."
I'm taking you at that word!!!  I should have thought about all the trashy lies they start before I doubted.  Keep doing what you are doing!!! You are doing what this country needs!
"I can think of a number of cities right here in the USA that fit that same metaphor.  whether Trump said it or not, the point to be made is not everywhere is a paradise"
Why does President Trump's straight talk still upset so many?  He isn't going to change...so maybe they should stop expecting him to do so!
"Mr. President, you MUST record every interaction with everyone from now until you are no longer President.  They're all out to get you, (even some in your own party), and they will say ANYTHING to stir up some sh*t on you."
And things you do and say can always get twisted. Sensible people knew exactly what you meant. Keep doing things your way and trust your instincts. Donald J. Trump POTUS
We like the fact that you tweet out the TRUTH . Never can hear the truth anymore. The Bible says It will come to pass that they will believe a lie.
Don't even waste your time worrying about the hypocrits and whiny babies...keep doing what your doing...
"Look who was in the meeting with Trump, Democrats and Rinos. Guys like Durbin, Flake and Grahemnasty are hardly allies."
"Too late...witness said you did...how many lies have you already told today?  6 per day is your average, but you exceeded that yesterday"
"Maybe itâ€™s just another spin to stop the â€œOprah for Pres.â€ù bashing.  All of a sudden, no more Oprah bashing on my feed today...back to Trump bashing....Hmmmm....."
"yes  you  should   record  , these  democrats   can""t  be  trusted   about  anything ,  so  sicl  .  i    hope  an independant    part   puts the  democrats  out of    business"
"Yup, notice the one that whined/lied is a dem?  If you had said anything wrong everyone in the room would have taken you to task right there in the meeting _Ÿ˜‰"
"Lindsey Graham did just tbat, and he confirmed what Durbin said."
Erica Parson haven't seen this on the news
We believe you Mr President and are very proud of You Sir !!! I have been praying that Truth would prevail over the lies of darkness! We are praying that the Mighty Lion of Judah would roar into the ears of American People and deafen the voice of the enemy and send his lying words into the ground !  God will turn this lying media upside down !!! _Ÿ™è_Ÿ™è_Ÿ™è
Good idea just let them know you are recording. Really that should take care of distractions like this.
"Ask any Haitian refugee now living in America id they would return to their country, & they will call it the same as you did!"
the noose is tightening on the sham Clinton Foundation....and the crooked Clintons....and half the swamp will probably go down with them...
Yes with the traitors you have to meet with you would do better to record as they will say anything derogatory to hurt you!
Jake Tapper admitted to lying about this!! _Ÿ˜¡
"Hang in there, Mr. Trump.  We've got your back, just like you're doing for us.  Keep up the good fight.  We thank you."
Amen!!
"Yes you did say it! What kind of president are you? Youâ€™re not running your company here, is a country..a pretty big country that is, and obviously you donâ€™t have what it takes to run it!"
Liberal Media lies about everything. I trust you President Trump. Not them. You are doing a great job undoing all the wrongs of Liberal Democrats. Continue the great work.
He is hinting at ethnically cleansing the US... he wants a genocide and most of his supporters would welcome it... that's the truth
Why aren't you coming to London many thousands of people were coming to support you and to counter the smelly unwashed ones who were going to protest against you
Don't worry about the left. They are a Cancer to our country. Every president has their flaws. You are doing a fabulous job!
"It's immensely disturbing how those democrats go on ways to affect your presidency. Please tell us their names so we can shame them as well. They're not American, they are traitors..."
omg this is better than any made up tv reality show...except a shitload of people could die if your small hands cant keep away from that big button!
"Of COURSE you have a WONDERFUL relationship with the Haitians, President Trump!  You LOVE the people, but we must naturally DIFFERENTIATE between the PEOPLE & the ENVIRONMENT.  Why I am certain that the Haitians would be the FIRST to acknowledge the POOR surroundings they live in.  We LOVE you!! âù_ï¸èâù_ï¸èâù_ï¸è"
Democrats are weak and lie about trump fake news. At the end of the day facts speak for themselves and stock market rises _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ_™ ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THEN WORDS
"I wish you would record all meetings and release anything unclassified.  If what you say is true, you could gain some actual credibility."
"Mr. President you could cure cancer the demwits would have a problem with something, keep up the great work"
"I trust Perdue and Cotton over Durbin and Graham. Perdue and Cotton both said President never said those words.That being said, President Trumps next move should be to let DACA expire and deport the illegal aliens. Democrats want to play SHITBALL? Trump should play along.!"
A genius can come up with better grammar to use and does not have to resort using vulgarity whether describing people or describing a country.
The only God and creator of all universes in heaven bless you mister president and commander in chief. the champion of the truth Mr DONALD J TRUMP and all your family's and friends.
Troubled country because the Clintons did such unethical things with the money that shouldâ€™ve gone to the Haitian people. Just ask the Haitian people they canâ€™t stand the Clintons.
We know what you said and we know what you mean and we understood what you meant. We don't need yet hundreds of thousands more on the backs of the rest of us.
It's your word against theirs. Can any of you produce evidence. It'd be very unfortunate if that's what you called us without any provocation.
"There is literal proof you called them ""shithole countries"" and also Norwegians aren't coming here because they are tied with Canada as having the highest quality of life the US isn't even in the top 10"
"We know, the Democrats will take whatever you say and turn it around to get people all upset. Most people know that you were talking about those countries conditions and not the people of those countries."
"There is no excuse from you Mr president. You have been against foreigners for awhile, this is not the first time. ...... if you dont like foreigners deport them instead of insulting them"
Haiti will thank you when their tourism industry explode$ from all the snowflakes that will be going there for holidays because it is such a beautiful place.
Please have a heart attack when you get your physical exam today.  And...I hope zero people come to your aid...now that's called WINNING>>>
Maybe a salty mouth will get things done for America. Political Correctness has got us in a mess in many ways. _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ_”
"I think recording everything you say, all day, everyday is a good idea. It would show the world what kind of fake news we have to listen to."
"The demoncrats will stop at nothing to get you out of office. They are horribly evil demons. Never trust a demoncrat. They lie, steal and kill."
With America and gun laws Iâ€™m surprised this old flake is still living. I forgot all the rednecks love this guy. #fuckhimintheass
POTUS keep doing what your doing.  Liberals are allowed to call you names and  conservative names.  But when the shoe is on the other foot they cry.
Africa? I'm 73 and for the most part of my life they still knock on the door for money to dig a well. How deep are they goin'?
"WOW, talk about epic karma  for  the Clintons! Wouldn't that be great. Greater would be to make them  give them funds from the foundation...ouch..."
Bill and Hillary sure know how to treat them. where is the money that was supposed to help them. More great Dem cover up. Lying and stealing are sure effective for the dems.
"God Bless you President Trump.  You say what most people think.   Thatâ€™s why we love love love you.  You make me laugh all the time, good for the soul."
"Note that nothing is permanent. Your time will come and you will be voted out of power and the world, not America, will be a better place to live."
"I always start the day with network news until they go to bashing Trump, which usually takes about 30 seconds, then I'm gone."
He said what everyone is thinking - but only he would say!  He's famous for this!  Now comes the 100000 comments:  That wasn't what I was thinking!
He absolutely did NOT say what I was thinking!
He's famous for saying what racists are thinking.....but not what most Americans are thinking and certainly not what the people who founded this country envisioned.
Cindy Wilson exactly!  My husband's parents came here as refugees after WWII.  His ancestry is Indian and Latvian.  Everyone who isn't Native American is an immigrant including Donald trump.
"Wow, just donâ€™t know who to believe, Senator Durkin who was in the same meeting and has pretty clean credentials, or Trump, a known pathological liar?"
"Trump has done more good for the black community and working class, in 11 months then Obama did in eight years !"
"Fake news!?, of course you said it, the world doesn't believe anything you've ever said, so why should anyone believe you didn't? You've lied about everything else so far!."
Didn't the earthquake happen eight years ago? I don't believe he was the president then. So why hasn't no one help them fix their country?? Hmmm
Since we know the media are a bunch of liars and they will never hold themselves accountable for lying... record everything.
Others can hang onto this and pass up on everything else that is going on. Sorry to say they will be left behind with their obcession
Agree....i think they may still find some of that $..   That horse's wedding did not cost that much.....where is the rest......it was billions people.....
"As usual, Trump is back-pedaling. One of these times heâ€™s going to back-peddle too far and fall off the edge of the earth. We can only hope!"
"In regards to lack of trust, is there actually a recording of ""the statement""? Has it actually happened, or was it just something in Durbin's mind?"
Yes recording would be good especially since you must realize they are  always out for your ars and it might help you to remember that!
"That's exactly what should be done, next time you can make the fake news outlets eat their words and prove once again they are liars."
"How can you say God is with you when this President does not ever know him ,he does everything that God is against If you believe in God you donâ€™t break his commandments then think he guiding you."
Tomorrow theyâ€™ll say something new. Well more likely it will be later today. At least theyâ€™re following you. _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
Perhaps President Trump should have all of his meetings recorded to prevent being misquoted or give the liberals a chance to misquote him.
Anytime thereâ€™s a Democrat in the room Iâ€™d record everything hang signs send out memos whatever tell them up front that you will be recording.
The mentally hateful left will say and use anything to make Trump and the countries best voters look bad. He says what we all think.
We do have to be more selective about who immigrates here. They need to have something to offer. Same as any other country expects.
Please record ALL future meetings and share them with the American public.  True transparency in government would help restore confidence.
"â€œUnfortunately, no trust!â€ù is the first thing 45 has said in a very long time that I believe 100%."
"Trump lies and then lies some more,  The man is disgusting and an embarrassment to all of us."
Do something right no one remembers.  Do something wrong no one forgets. ..even the lies of other politician's
"ALL meetings which are not dealing with national security should be recorded. That would prove what was, and was not, said."
"So says the habitual fugly pos Liar. The narrative remains the same cheetodonny, Russia and Treason! The Mueller train is coming for you. #IMPEACHNOW"
And they love him too I remember him being invited to hear there plea what the evil ones did with there millions when Americans collected it to help them after there disaster
"Pretty safe to say the Haitians don't think a lot of Hillary and the Democrats in this country.Typical libtards....always accusing everyone else of the very thing they are guilty of. Sure would be nice if Shumer would developed lock jaw and stfu."
"Yes, you should record all meetings.  Dems have shown they cannot negotiate in good faith. Nor can their â€œleaksâ€ù be trusted."
"While Purto Rico was crying for help, Trump was colluding with Russia. Trump was giving the KGB top secret information via General Michael Flynn and his son - in - law. This is why Flynn took a [plea deal]."
"President Trump, I have faith in you, and I really think there are those that use your every word against you.  I am very upset by all of this."
"There seems to be a lot of backstabbers in you Administration, unfortunately maybe taping meetings would be a good idea!"
"But we agree that the shithole countries do come here illegally,  We don;t see too many illegal Swiss, Dutch, or Finnish coming here , so we?"
I think it is best that you record your meetings Mr. President. Even we in that insurance world record our meeting! This will stop the overwhelming bad news!!!!!
I just love you more and more each day. You speak the truth and politicians go cracy. Keep on the good work please! _Ÿ˜˜
Just STOP and THINK about what you are saying.  If you give the media nothing to criticize for......they would only be talking about ALL the GOOD you are doing to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
"We know President Trump. It is all a farce and distraction from what should truly be ""news""! Beyond that, we all remember what Hillary said about we, the people of America. At least you didn't call the Haitian people ""deplorables""!!!!!"
Reading the comments of people who actually still support him are actually terrifying. You morons are going to get us all killed.
I would be more careful around the dems and establishment Republicans. I would sooner trust the Russsians than those Swamp Snakes!
We stand beside you President Trump all of us who voted for you. Keep up the good work. May God continue to bless you and your family.
Who cares !! Keep going!! The media and dems never going to stop inventing drama around you! And by the way dems Love shitholes look Detroit...
"Hi, I would like to make a humble suggestion to the current President of the United States, Donald Trump. If you want to leave your name in the history of the world forever, you should become familiar with the UFO issue and be the first public man, and leader of the most powerful nation in the world, then the most powerful man in the world, publicly acknowledge the existence of such alien beings. It's just a matter of time for the truth on this subject, be revealed and known without a shadow of doubt by everyone on the planet. Anticipate this happening as the teller of this obvious truth. In doing so, he had left an eternal legacy, forever registering his name in the world's history."
_Ÿ˜€_Ÿ˜€_Ÿ˜€
Send illegals home and build the wall. Don't get sucked into gossip by a Democrat. They know they can rely on dependent illegals for votes!!
"Keep on keeping on Mr. President, I do not pay any attention to what the Democrats and left wing news say, I and everyone else that voted for you can see the truth by what is happening all around the great U.S. of A."
"Attention:If you have a dream don't go to your grave without saying ""I MADE IT"".That's what matters.Cheers and good luck to your hustle. Instagram: @andremuhozya"
"Yeah, record it like the last guy...what was his name? Hmmm. Oh yeah, that was Nixon. He was also a very well-respected genius."
Record all meetings and don't release the tapes until 2019.  You can crush the democrats by exposing their lies and deceit.
document everything!  That way there is proof of what is or isn't said and if it's on audio you'd even be able to tell what the tone of voice is.
Yes. Record all meeting. So pretty soon the libtards will have nothing to say because proof of conversations prevents them from lying.
Maybe it wouldn't be in such bad shape if the clintons hadn't stolen the money meant to rebuild this country.
"No need to explain, we have a heads up on the frauds they are.  They are a cancer to truth of any kind. Let's continue to MAGA!!!!!!!!!!!"
Isn't that something seems the only Democrat in the meeting that said something about that ain't that funny I believe Trump before I believe any Democrat
You should have been recording a long time ago; but they will say-I don't care what's on the tape; he said it.
"Of Course they spin â€˜stuffâ€™ same day Wal-Mart gives their employees â_êï¸èbonuses & raises.What other â€˜cardâ€™ do they have?."
"Good idea, record everything.  Because the left are leading their to the slaughter and they have turned backs on the people. My opinion"
I never listen to the Dems no matter what they say.  Most people with any brains are the same they donâ€™t listen to the Dems we all know they are fake people
so now all your meeting need to be recorded..ok fine...and you can't trust the trouble maker that was in the meeting either..
Yes please record o and thank for the extra on our paychecks this time tax breaks I guess some people don't like extra $ either
"Not exactly sure why you would ever trust a Democrat. Remember what they did to George H. W. Bush, they can never be trusted."
"I donâ€™t care what he says, heâ€™s better than anybody any one else could come up with. And I love, love, love the balances on my financial statements these days."
"Good idea!  We were tired of Fake Politicians and wanted a truthful real person. That's why we elected you, President Trump. The Peoples President!"
"The democrat, socialist, communist, party just go on trying to take down America.     Stop the take over .  Nazis were the resistance"
Why do ppl even repeat crap that was said in these private meetings? Canâ€™t trust any politician....except the potus.
"How about the other shithole countries,how about aid to Puerto Rico?? All of you are in a different world than the rest of us. I am glad not to be in your world."
maybe you should record it then maybe I wouldn't look at you and see a terrible person. I really don't believe you and yes I would like to be proven wrong.
Cancel all forms of aid to those countries who keep sending or causing their citizens to illegally come to our country!
"Obama made his own visa which I forgot the name, thatâ€™s how this killer in New York came. Vote republican where honest people."
Its all democratic political smears timed after a meeting on Tuesday that showed they wont compromise an inch-- because DACA means votes.
"I would have been irate too, after the ridiculous proposal you just received. You say a dirty word but so what who caresMove on"
"Even if you did say it, it was the truth. We elected you because we don't want to hide behind political correctness"
Again the Democrats do not listen they here what they want to here and make it fit their agenda-To bring world socialism to America.
I thought the same thing.   How about getting some people that will help us instead of those that want to take advantage of us.
"When the day comes and you have to look the Lord in the eye to explain why you felt the need to lie, I hope you are prepared for that moment"
"TROLL ALERTCheck the Facebook pageCalifornia liberal troll"
Aletha Karen Bass just a California voter. Nice deflection attempt though
What about the statement Africa and s...hole?  That's the one they keep talking about.  Did he or didn't he say that?  Need to clear that one up.
Closed door meeting so who is the one making up this crap? Tell us who was there and we the people will vote the joker out.
Please do record all your activities in office. Get started right away and don't stop until you're gone. We don't trust you.
I know that they are very good workers but we need a good immigrant program for those who want to assimilate.   We have too many illegals.
"Mr president anything you said. Your enemies will run with it.  Just be mindful of the way you express your self, when you're with your enemies.  We still pray for you."
"I was getting concerned, itâ€™s been at least 20 hours since heâ€™s lied about this. Seems like the Don might be losing his touch"
Let's all remember how recording meetings went for Nixon and approve of this wholeheartedly.
"Looks like my snowflake friend Shannon Boone has unfriended me. Good luck in the future with your liberal hipocracy. As for me,  TRUMP In 2020! yes, he is STILL your president. Lol"
Yes what about what rhe klinton foundation did to haiti as a ciuntry picketed millions of relief funds that were supposed to go to help a cash strapped devastated country recover????? Wheres the coverage on this andd where is justice
Please try to not pay attention to the haters...we the true Americans know you are the best thing that has happened to this country.  God is with you and so are we.
Wow the trumpanzees are on board with their marmalade Mussolini .... speaks volumes about the intelligence level in hillbillydom
President Trump we all new this and Continue to support you!!!!  Do not think for a moment we are going to turn our backs on you!
I wanna know why they are poor when the USA has given them millions upon millions of dollars!!!!!????? Where does all that $$$$$ go?????
"If your nation is not one then make your selves up to avoid insult, if only you call it insult. Be motivated than complain."
Here we have again he said/they said who is right.  Personally I feel what is said by anyone behind closed doors should stay there.
What is said in the oval office should stay in the oval office. Iâ€™m quite sure worse things have been said in our 200+ year history....
You do need to record every meeting so when this happens again and it will all you have to do is play it back. Please do that for us.
Dems are so hateful they hear what they want to here they are so jealous of what he is doing they cant stand themselves look are our economy it is thriving Obama never did this!
"Hussein Obama=Arabic, Sunni from Saudi Arabia not from Iran"
"I agree, Lived in CA for 5 yrs. It was easy to see where the Mexican community lived. Trash, junk everywhere in their neighborhood. Blasting music, kids running in the streets, at all hours of the day or night. And no you can't avoid driving in these areas and take another route...they are EVERYWHERE!!"
California is glad you left. God forbid a community play music and have children that play outside. What a joke!
you have a right to your opinion as well
Good deal. I support their deportation. It was temporary. If they qualify to apply for citizenship I do think they should.
It must be exhausting having to constantly defend everything you do or say to retarded & mentally unstable libtwats
"Progressives have always been allowed to have free speech,  but aren't they the ones that are behind stopping free speech at Colleges today?"
"If you said this in a closed door meeting, why is it okay for Dick Dufus to say the same thing on live TV? The ignorance is astonishing!!!!"
"Mr. President, let me fix that for you. â€œToday we mark and mourn the eighth anniversary of the earthquakes which devastated our close neighbor and friend, Haiti. Once again, I pledge the unwavering support of the United States to this longtime ally, whose citizens fought alongside ours in the Revolutionary War, and who for two centuries have enriched our economy and culture. Iâ€™m happy to announce today that we will be extending protected status to all Haitians living in the United States. Neighbors take care of neighbors, and as always the United States stands with Haiti and the Haitian people.â€ù"
"yes record, Trump is known for stiffing contractors, declaring bankruptcies, flip flopping on positions -- please, Trump cannot be trusted, record!"
"There is so much ignorance in this world.  A lot of people on this string don't know what a great america looks like.  Well, it looks like this......"
"Lets find out what the Dems. say at their private meetings.  I am sure it is a lot worse than what they are reporting.  Just remember they are not your friends, Mr. President."
"Recording is a great idea , then let the low lifeâ€™s and the press try and twist and look like the Shitheadsâ€ù they are!!!!"
Never trust the democrats President Trump. They are not your friends. They didnâ€™t win anything so donâ€™t let them get what they want.  Every person the Republicans have elected turned on us and voted with the democrats. Donâ€™t let it happen with you. Give them nothing. They donâ€™t deserve anything the way they have treated you.  No daca!!!!! Stand your ground and build that wall!!!!
"Good idea, Richard Nixon recorded everything or wrote it down on paper. Be careful it can turn on you and bite you in the butt."
Henry kissinger should be investigate for his zionist nwo agenda. An agenda that goes against the American people.
Does anyone know if there are any Republicans willing to corroborate Trump's version of events? I haven't been able to find any.
YES record everything and then when the media posts lies then you can have cause for the FCC to shut them down as news broadcasting agencies.
Words taken out of context and the Lib spin--It would benefit our country to have people come in that are education and be productive.
Oh because you might have said shitHOUSE instead??  You are a child and an abomination.  You are hated in every corner of the world.  Quit now and die soon please
"Why would we believe you, never in our history have we had such a shameful President in the Oval Office! Your claim to fame in history."
"Peter Heck, we don't give a crap what you think.  You must have forgotten already what Obama did for 8 years!!"
"It's so funny the democrats take the moral high ground and are offended by what Trump said. Seriously, has no one ever said that about some undesirable location? I may have added God Forsaken, my self. I read briefly that Nancy Pelosi got in trouble with the phrase ""five white guys"" in reference to our leaders. But why? They are five white guys. She was just being honest.....like Trump was."
"There are places around the world,and in fact the USA thanks to Democrats that some might consider shitholes by definition in the dictionary."
Cant wait to see how low the low life scums approval ratings fall this week. Trump limbo!  How low will they go before he IS no longer.
You cant say the truth anymore we border with Mexico they dump trash into  US waters every month they are a s--t hole country
You keep doing right Mr President. The left will keep lying all the time. The dems are a mess in delusion of the devil.
"Really ""shithole"" country in Africa!  What kind of a  understatement you made about one of the richest country read your history books."
"Again, lets go back to WHO said he said these things??? Were they leaked from a PRIVATE conversation? Were they made up?  Lets nail THAT down, shall we?"
everyone in his cab is lying? but its the world that is lying and you never said that? oh hell yes u did! retract and apologize.
"Keep doing those public meetings to discuss issues, Mr. President. You shine and Democrats are on record."
All of every presidents meetings are recorded so no words can be twisted or forgotten. Even small government offices do that.
"So Donald thinks he had all the power in the universe, but he should remember at last six feet, god would punish u the day u would die"
********Durbin and 5 others for presenting President Trump with their *********immigration policy and then running out and bomblasting the President. So much for a private meeting.
Maybe we should worry about fixing up our own crap holes first...that would be a good start before bringing in more dependency.
Real Americans know the truth investigate all money sent to and check into the corrupt charities that collected money and did nothing
"You're right Mr. President. Great people can be from really crappy places, doesn't mean the people are less than great."
"So tell us all what was really said then.   We support you, but if you're going to state that the words were not said, please clarify then.  #MAGA"
He said shithole. Understand?
Washington Post released the story first and he allegedly stated that.    No confirmations.... understand that?
I wish he could record these meetings.  Wouldn't it be great to actually hear the truth and not what leakers spread as truth.  Either way - the truth.
She's also not President and ultimately that doesn't negate what Trump has said or done in the travesty that is the Putin administration.
"I am positive that the relief founds are in Clintonâ€™s bank account, and the Democrats and the press are silent about that.Let our president work and protected our country!"
"If you stop being defensive, YOU would realize what comes out of your mouth. YOU do day these things. Learn better behavior."
"Funny... No matter WHAT the conversation - ain't it odd the 45ites can turn it into HILLARY or OBAMA.  I heard a 45 pastor start talking about NFL players mothers.  Their entire stategy is denial & diversion.  You can't hold an intelligent discussion with them at all.  Just say Hillary, Hillary, Hillary, Obama, Hillary, Obama, Hillary - and walk away.  They'll think they won."
"No one would leave there country if it was economically viable, had opportunity, a good health system and all around happiness. Letâ€™s face it some countries are Shitholes. For instance, Iran, Yemen, Syria, Cuba, Haiti, El Salvador, and more.  If these countries were viable, there would be no reason to emigrate to America or any other country. And speaking about Haiti, the past leaders of that country sent it into downward spiral by taking aid money and keeping it for themselves.  Haitian people had no chance. Even the Clintons and associates monetarily pillaged that country."
I don't understand the in and out of politics but I know when a good and well meaning man is dragged through the mud for 'political gain!'
But you have all these recordings. You said you had recording during the election and refused to release them. Youre gonna start now?
So they can return to live in these wonderful culturally enriched diverse places right? They don't need to come here for a better life.
What ever you said Mr President doesn't  matter to the democrats or the media they are going to make it look like you are the bad guy
Dem really need to stop fighting against you. Just keep moving forward. We the people know how ugly they can be. We love you and support you .
Ha! What a weasel!  Man up to what you say and believe.  Your base loved your shithouse comment. Tell us how you really feel.
So just to make sure I understand this ... everyone is lying including your administration that admitted you said that? Which one is it?
"Read what he said, They just added to it.He did call it like he sees it, a SHITHOLE and it is thanks to Hellary who stole all the money that was suppose to go to them. Have you forgotten about all the money that disappeared, how convenient."
"If these people are poor in their country, won't they be poor here. Oh wait, we give them benefits, good jobs and welfare!!!! LOL"
"Did he really need to state the obvious.... About a lot of these countries. Lol, I guess people just hate to hear the truth!"
Don't worry Donald I'm with you okay I just want to take it out of context and make you look bad because I wanted to stray away from what you're really wanted to accomplish in this presidency the Democrats just want to make it look bad for you no matter what you do but don't worry I'm behind you and I'll look for you again
Like I've always said you have been the most lying president in the world so you lie about everything you make people feel so bad and I think it's because you are not happy with yourself so you have to make other people feel bad so you could feel bigger that is sad that we have a president like you in the United States I'm so ashamed
"You are funny. =D Compared to Hi LIAR y, Donald's an angel.."
"Run along lib, go live in Haiti & give us a call & let us know what a shithole it is since you donâ€™t want to believe the truth. Or just try Chicago (another democrat run shithole) since youâ€™re too much of a hypocrite to leave the US."
President Trump.....you are doing a great job!!!  Keep it up.  You have a big heart and are very caring.  Actions speak louder than words.
"â€œIt is certain, in any case, that ignorance, allied with power, is the most ferocious enemy justice can have.â€ù - James A. Baldwin"
The news stations are Always trashing you Mr Pres  if it wasn't for You the News stations would go broke they have Nothing to report about ha ha...
"The poll takers are asking the wrong people, just like they did when they predicted Hillary would win the election!"
"I never doubted you. Too many gullibles who are not reading between the lines. They take anything posted by the fake media and ran with it, hearsay as it is."
"S***HOLE NEWS  I would believe that so sick of hearing and reading this kind of crap get over it Obama isn,t coming back thank god"
So people are offended by fake words but the Clinton took $50million dollars designated to help the Haitians and nothing??
Durbin is a snake and proved Democrats canâ€™t be trusted! And thus the problem! This was a closed meeting!!!
I'm gutted you have decided to not come over to England. Was looking forward to the crowd singing abusive songs about you Donald.
"When you give the hard earned tax money way some should a countable, so suck it up you do gooders. It's high time this should be done."
God will take care of those that lie. Keep trusting in the Lord for your wisdom.  Don't fall pray to those that are carers of lies!
"The Whitehouse reminds me of a 1st grade playground.  Always tatting on one another.  ""Teacher! Teacher! Somebody said a naughty word.""_Ÿ˜_"
It's OK Trump...i said the same thing last week about a different place..yes some places have turned into shitholes...not referring to the people.
"I donâ€™t care what you said, it is totally ridiculous that the so called media is obsessed with it, they hate you. We the people love you."
"You don't need to record your meetings.  You've said enough vile things on the record, we know that you're a petulant bigoted man-baby."
I thought it was fake news again! Why don't they get a life and try to help make this place better instead of making up lies all the time!
Now Dick Durbin is the great communicator if he is so upset why didnâ€™t he say anything in the meeting yesterday. Instead of going to the media
Real shame we have someone who loves or country and is making a difference in which we can actually see a difference yet people hate.
Whether or not you said it doesn't matter to me. You should record though because traitors and liars are everywhere!
"It doesnâ€™t matter to me either.. if he did say it .. I view it not about color but take it from an economic standpoint.. thatâ€™s why people are wanting to leave.. not our fault their leaders, their politicians havenâ€™t kept their own country up and to improve living conditions for their country and their people.. shouldnâ€™t tank our country.. my thoughts"
"Yes that's exactly how I see it, plus, he's tired of the U.S. saving everyone at the expense of us taxpayers. America first."
"No one is talking about what the Clintons did to Haiti, just ehat the President said or didn't say! Mr. President, for your own benefit, please record all meetings, because they are out to get you!!"
"President Donald J. Trump the whole thing is another made up WAPO story and we know that. It is called an Ad Hominem  argument, when they can't find fault in your policies the #MSM and #Democrats and #liberals resort to attacking you as an individual. It's sad that the #MSM is so deplorable. No source cited but an unnamed person who was NOT in that meeting sickening. _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸ï¸è_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸ï¸è_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸ï¸è"
"Don't forget, The Clinton Foundation was in charge of rebuilding Haiti with a $10B government grant.  They built one hospital, a couple hundred houses, and LOADS of cell phone towers which were leased to a Clinton friend.  That gave said friend a monopoly on cell phone usage on the island, with cash going into Clinton's pockets.So, if the place is a shithole, you can thank the Clinton's, who've never been held accountable."
zionist hillary whom sent that income to rebuild Israel and Russia
"But Hillary can say those people are deplorable and get a free pass...oh wait, she was talking about Americans! MAGA!!"
"Please record your meetings..want your hate and prejudicial statements recorded, I will help to get you impeached sooner then later!!"
Don't be defensive.  Remind them the theft the Clintons committed against the Haitians.  Actions are louder than words.
"Yep, record. Can't trust those people. They have their own selfish agenda which has nothing to do with the good of the country or the good of DACA."
You can't even nod your head when someone else is talking or you said it...Recording would be good...PTA
"Never trust a LibFraud. These are the people that promised Ronald Reagan, give us 5 million and weâ€™ll build the wall."
"Democratic Party is a party that will say anything to stop you from looking good they are the a party of no talent ,drain the swamp (Democratic Party )"
"Would be very nice to record meetings, especially the all Republican ones but being open would be a nice change."
A Person who is mental sound just can't refer to immigrants regardless were   come from as #Shitholes!!! You just wrong Mr Trump.
"Nobody love Haitians better than me, believe me. I bigly love them, love em all over. Grab em by the pussy, and they let me because im famous"
*Hugely you meant Iâ€™m sure
Either one works for me
You trump lover you
Calling a shithole country a shithole country seems...OK! Challenge any of the Demoncrats to PROVE tghey do not use common language.
They all hate the Clintons and Bushes for Ripping them  off ! The Country is not in good Shape - as bad as a Hellhole - but we can't take in a whole  Country ! We have lots of Problems already !
Too many sell outs sitting on pins n needles waiting on POTUS to say something wrong. U fools have no life. Shut the hell up.
There are times our President can be his own worse enemy. There are people that think this only our President says it..publicly
"Good Grief! Why does supposedly Good Media breathlessly report  a story from Bad Media that is from Anonymous Sources?  Once it's checked, then mention truth or FAKE story."
The democrats and msm will always find something to make you look bad. Even if they have to twist it or make it up! MAGA!
The truth is sometimes hard to take but it is none the less the truth.  When someone speaks it they are shut down or called crazy.  Keep speaking the truth Mr. President.  :)
Trump is cleaning up Clinton and Obama's messes. He did not do any of this. Yet he is right about the immigration issue
"Given the amount of leaks, recording meetings would be a good idea! This has been an agenda by the left to destabilize the present administration from the get go. Apparently the only way to stop this is to record every closed door meeting. There is a 2 fold reason for this particular attack it seems. One is to derail immigration reform. The other is retribution for having a televised bipartisan meeting! This made it impossible for opponents to do their typical underhanded denials! It made it impossible to do what was just done after a closed door meeting."
There ARE countries that are shitholes due to their corrupt governments! That doesn't translate to the people of the countries!
"Stop tweeting so much,some things are better off not said start with that,you only have to keep exposing your self,please."
"The main stream r forging things up, they r dem biased but u r always many steps a head of em Mr president , i salute u sir."
"Perhaps when Trey Gowdy gets Hilary charged and (dare I say it?) in jail, the press will stop their constant harassing of the POTUS"
"They will try and make up whatever they can to get people to hate you, most us with common sense see thru these childish games."
If their lying about what your saying then cut off all access ! Give Don Lemon and the lying media no access at all !
Not doing a Snow dance here in Winston Salem Sharon. Praying it hits u guys again....I enjoyed todays 65 degrees weather today
"Once again, POTUS loves to spread â€œalternative factsâ€ù and has been proven to not be 100% truthful. Unless, he has unedited tapes to prove he didnâ€™t say it, I (many) am not going to â€œbelieveâ€ù him."
"whats words compared to w Clinton "" foundation"" did.. no news on that thou.. wonder why that is.. hummm ... anyone wonder who controls w the news reports ? that the answer"
Whoâ€™s lying you or Durbin? Since youâ€™re a lying sack of Big Macâ€™s Iâ€™m going to go with you being the liar _Ÿ_¥. Canâ€™t wait until the 25th amendment â€œtakes you outâ€ù. âœŒ_Ÿè_
"Easy fix... make ALL your meetings confidential, Mr. President so that if anything is leaked to the media you can prosecute the leaker.  Easy Peasey!"
You can not trust a democrat or the news media - they both are trying to push socialism on the country...
"Shithole country, that is what you said. Wash your mouth before you speak and everything will be fine. For now, it does smell."
"If you said it or not is beside the point I have been to these countries and a lot more 3rd world countries the people for the most part are great but all would agree as of today they are s-holes and they want out of them, Haiti is run by the UN for last 7 years and if possible been turned into a 10th world country. Gangs and corrupt government run El Salvador every where communist, socialist and liberals have touched has turned into s holes. Thatâ€™s what they plan for us. I have watched it since the 80â€™s slow degrading of the US. Mr. President thank you for trying to fix but unless your firing the whole socialist controlled government from congress down itâ€™s just a stalling action most American true American no longer have faith in government."
If he said it publicly yes he shouldn't have but c'mon for lack of a better word what else would we call it?
"You will NEVER be able to trust any Dems. Do not change for them! They keep trying to smear you, we all see through them. #MAGA"
Find the liar and then never let him in the room with you again.  Shame them in public.  This should have never happened.  Point him out.
Democrats are only concerned about immigrants being â€œA Critical Component Of The Democratic Partyâ€™s Future Electoral Successâ€ù
Why hey want the black brown the poor uneducated.  Theyll cinvince them that reoublicams hate them. Add to their base.
"Absolutely no trust of the Dems. They may look and talk nice to you, Sir, but their whole focus unfortunately is on â€œRESISTANCE.â€ù"
"You say so much you can't remember what you said. Kinda like filing your Tax return on a Post Card.  I knew the day you said it, you were a joke."
We believe you Mr President!!  But we can't trust the liberals..they don't want you to succeed..and admit they were wrong..keep up the good work!!
"But it is a shithole , sometimes the truth is ugly , all need to see it for what it is before any real change can ever take place."
"Still can't figure out why someone would be sorry for telling the truth. I'd rather have the truth than someone who claims that socialized healthcare will work just because they can't admit they are a failure; or someone who hides the fact that they financed terrorism until they were caught. They have every right to care enough to fix their own country. Who knows, they may even have a country they are proud of one day.  I know I'm proud of my country again.  Thanks President Trump!"
"Doctors without Borders even pulled out of Haiti.  They were being extorted by street gangs, and went to the police.  They then found out the local police chief and gang boss were brothers.  They left rather than pay ""street taxes"" to do provide free medical care."
What you said about Africa is true.Am from Africa.No apologies.You should send all Africans back home to build their countries.
"Yes, please record EVERYTHING!! It will be easier to see what the Dems, I mean you, are lying about.  Hell, it would be easier to see what everyone is lying about!"
He'd just edit it!
"People leave their families behind, and take life and death risks to get here, I guess they're coming from shitholes....MAGA.."
I spent some time in Panama and Panama City and found that country a shithole. The poorest trying to survive under the tyrannical military elite.
"Mr Trump, when I ask US Military here in the UK what they think of your policies, the reply is ""We have been advised not to talk about our commander-in-chief"".#NotFakeNews"
"I believe you, but please don't give them anymore ammunition with some of your unfavorable words ok Mr President?!!?"
"No on DACA. Complete the wall. Continue winning by deporting illegals and bringing back business.The MSM is turned to hatred long ago."
"Can I just ask why Haitians are piling into Canada then ,now we have to go into more debt to pay for them !"
Imagine this Martin Luther King jr. holiday this weekend and just before that one Democrat stands out and tries to take up race riot again imagine that
"Have every thing as open as possible so everyone can see what the rotten liberals does, no closed doors unless absolutely necessary."
JAIL the media for being a political advocate and swaying the intervention of voters with deceipt and lies  we are all getting tired of their crap.....
"ALL Dem pols are mandated to take a two-week vacation in ""The Shitholes""; their opinions of same will be measured and published pre and post-visit. Thanks for once again being brutally honest, PRESIDENT Trump!"
So he said shithole. Did it hurt YOUR feelings. You people hace said and done FAR WORSE to our president. Let him do his job and make our Country strong AGAIN..
"The problem though President Trump is you have people like Ann Coulter and Stephen Miller Who are pushing you to adopt almost Israeli-like policies based on race, ethnicity, and religion. That is actually illegal in the United States. Continuing down that train of thought will get you into trouble. You should be careful. Quite frankly some of your advisors are terrible. You really should talk to Chris Christie more."
All the people trying to pick at this would never visit Haiti anyways or any of the other countries you mentioned. It's just the usual whiners looking for another reason to whine.
Recording should be required as there seems to be some evidence that you are a liar liar pants on fire.
"Iâ€™m sure no Congressman ever swears in their office, they are just delicate snowflakes. Give me a break, MAGA!"
trump I like u so much u are like we Banyamulenge but plz accept we refugees to go to USA even if we stay there for a period of time and we come back but when we have reached
"Send some Democrats to run Haiti. With any luck they'll work their magic like in Detroit, Chicago, or Newark."
Oh by the way i stopped watching the news and my life is much better for it. It is not lie it was in my grannys day when we heard about the weather.
Yes you should trump the Dems don't want to work with you obviously.. so any meetings you have with that party record everything that is said.
"Trump, just give them NOTHING.Stop talking so much.They will make everything up any how.Why bother giving them cannon fodder?"
Youâ€™re  such a fricken LIAR!!!!!!! Youâ€™re only saying this bull_Ÿ’© because you got caught. Blame everyone but yourself like always_Ÿ™„_Ÿ™„
"YES, I was going to post that idea to your page! Record everything that you say even if you don't record what others say."
"I'm SO tired of all the distractions!!!  NO amnesty!!! If the bozos are not going to fix this, let it go to the voters!!! We know what we want!!!"
"Just remember, this outrage comes from people who find it acceptable to walk around wearing vaginas."
Well theres also something to be said for the millions of Hatians tgat left to come here. Obviously cannot be the best place to live.
"I'd rather have a President who speaks the plain truth than one who uses double speak and lies, then wrings his hands and wets his pants.  Obama?"
"I stand with you Mr. President, now if the media would let it go and get behind you too, we could all work to make America great again."
We stand with you President Trump. No matter what you say or do the left will be there to try to take you down. There is no satisifying them. How sad for them!!
"I'm guessing your MLK message has been scrapped!!! If I were you, I'd just go cower in a white supremacist corner somewhere."
If I were you I wouldn't forget my safe space and Cocoa hour. Thank God I'm not you.
"Never trust any Democrat or RHINO with anything you say or do, they want to destroy you & our country."
If I were you Donald I'd stay away from recording conversations. It's gone badly for you in the past!
"Is it possible to fire these people with all the false reports.  What bothers a lot of us, is that so many eat the crap that's being output."
How disgraceful for americans to have a president who speaks in such a manner. The only thing poor about this situation is your language as a president.
@ President Donald Trump- In reference to Recording future meetingsâ€_ Yeah think? Should have been doing it since day one!
The democRATS and LibTARDS are going nuts... LMASOL. And they are running out of things to say about our President. TRUMP 2020 AND BEYOND.
"Please start recording,then you won't be able to lie about what u said.grow a pair and admit it.#KEEPDRINKINGTHETRUMPTARDKOOLAID"
"Youâ€™ve lost my trust many moons ago, nothing you say can be believed because of your history of lie after lie after lie after lie!"
It's sad how people believe everything the fake media says. You are doing a fantastic job President Trump!
Funny how everything has to get spun back to ANYONE but the POS sitting in the White House. What does his disgusting comments have to with the Clintons!?!?
"Recording is a ""must"" thing to do with all of the corrupted people in both Congress (both parties) and many in the media."
"It only makes sense to look at culture, accomplishments, beliefs, etc. of immigrants to see if they are compatible with our culture, accomplishments, beliefs, etc.  Haiti is a Voodoo nation and has been rewarded accordingly.  It doesn't matter what color people are, when they practice/worship Voodoo, they will not be blessed nor will their nation be blessed.  People can make their own ""shithole"" by the way they live their lives and beliefs they practice."
Ask Crooked Hillary where all the money the Clinton Foundation raised for Haitian relief went to. Investigate the Clinton Foundation now.
"â€œI have a wonderful relationship with Haitians, more wonderful than anyone else in this world, the best, the greatest everâ€ù"
"Ironic that millionaire Hollywood actors ranting about this on Twitter, which CENSORS opposing tweets. Talk about a bubble!"
It seems like all their answers to questions is always about somebody else instead of taking care of the situation that was originally address.
"Traitors all around you .. Please be careful! #DrainTheSwamp #MAGA If anyone hates the Haitians, it Hillary.. She stole their money!"
"If it weren't for the Clintons stealing the charity money, they wouldn't be where they are...make them pay it back"
Way to go freedom of speech!  We may not like what he says but at least he speaks the truth. He just says whay we all think.
WE ALREADY know the DNC lies like RUGS !! To bad most Dem voters aren't very aware of what our DNC does behind our backs !!
"Yes, President Trump - record everything.  No matter what you say or do they will twist it.  I believe you as well as your supporters."
Your tweets are hurtful but is not as hurtful as Clinton Foundation squandered the funds for Haitians.
You cant trust democrats with anything they are out there to take you out President trump next time please record any meeting with democrats!
The real shithole is where your petulant leader walks. The real shitheads are his supporters.  Each and every one of them.
I hate working with people that start drama too. A bunch of little school girls in Washington who like to stir up trouble.
"yes you have no choice but to record and release transcripts when they lie about you,. sadly many of the people want to believe the press so badly they will believe anything."
This country is 240 years old beautiful place their country eons old still the same eons later why would't they want to be here.
After 240 years we should evolve as we go and devolve.were like the picture of mans evolution except in reverse.we as a country are devolving to a simean nature
"Here's the thing, Mr. President. You have to stop believing you have ANY friends. You don't. You cannot trust one single person around you. You're going to have to assume that no one around you has the slightest clue of what you think and why you think it. You're going to have to make them sit for the extra five minutes in the beginning so you can say EXACTLY what you mean, including the foundational basis for what you're about to say. This was careless. The battle is hot enough. PLEASE slow down. You do not need to fill every moment with words. You are on the right track, policy-wise. DON'T let careless mistakes derail you...and us."
"I love Alveda King.. She speaks the Truth. The Idiots including MSM, Global Media, Two-bit Entertainers, Maxine Waters, Pelosi, Obama do not."
"Sticks and stones break bones, but words do not hurt anyone.  Sometimes the truth must be spoken in order to fix the problems."
"you make me laugh... you are so not credible as a Presid... (will not finish the word, because you are not worthy of that status)."
you are who you are a free spirit who tells it like it is thats why people woke up for you were put were you are by the SMARTONES thankyou for all you have dun and and what's to come!!!!
They are S...Hole country including were i come from you telling the truth Mr president I still support you.
I  really hate those who lie and cause scandal.  May they repent or else may what they say come back upon their own heads.
"I pray and love you Mr President. Thank you for making America great again, and draining the swamp spending our taxpayers money!"
The interesting thing to me is would any of the folks criticizing our President want to give their life up here and live in one of those countries....i think not.
Can't trust the democrats at all.   Recited everything and replay it.   But they will still give false info.   Don't agree to anything they want.
"Even so, sometimes a truth is spoken in jest, sometimes it's even warranted. It's not a Ferrari in every garage all over the world."

"Cesar RamosHow would you know, are you on it?"
"Mr. President , why do you think the Democrats have always been known as ""the Party of treason ""? Don't trust a one of them . MAGA !"
Will continue praying for you!  You will walk through your enemies!  Will pray for God to give you a mouth to refute everyone of your enemies!!!
President Trump : Usually when you are negative on something you say it openly. I want to be to you like Taft was to Roosevelt.  I want to be your right hand man !!!!
How about live coverage like the meeting earlier with the Dems and Republicans in the room. Kinda hard for reporters to lie when it on the air
"Mr. President, at least you got the country talking about this. That's a good thing. Thank you for making this country great again. And thank you for speaking the unfiltered truth."
"I like a person with no filter. If a place is a shithole, call it a shithole....the people who get offended probably belong in said shithole"
"Personally, I'm tired of politicians who give diplomatic, hearts and flowers, what you want to hear rhetoric, then they do the opposite when the press isn't there.  At least with President Trump, he says what he's thinking.  We know where he stands and he follows thru with it.  I don't agree with everything he says or does, but I don't agree with anyone 100 percent of the time."
"Yes, #POTUS, record every meeting. Recording some, but not all cause people to suspect you are hiding something. Try not to be ""Tricky"", like Nixon."
"Even if you did state them, theyâ€™re true!  Who was the jack*** that leaked it?  Heâ€™s the real embarrassment."
Didn't believe it anyway Mr. President! Jesus has hand on you! God bless America and have mercy on those seeking to destroy it!
You should anyway apologize for your statement over the way you see African countries even though this was alleged..
"Donald J. Trump - Whatever was said, you and YOU alone, control what comes out of your heart, and your mouth. As the President of the United States, no matter your frustration - you have to make a decision to be above this type of vulgar comments. A simple apology would go a long way to shutting down this bizarre mis-step."
"LÃ_genpresse"" (lying press) is a defamatory word most frequently used in Nazi Germany."
Morgan Randall unfortunately our press does LIE!
Please do tape meetings you have so many leakers surrounding you. I am totally with you but be less trusting of people around you
You have the best the biggest most wonderful relationship Don we all know that . The fake media you just trust those guys to report how wonderful you are
What about the hitman that was hired by the Clintons and   'allegedly' killed 60 people for them... But that's not in the news..
"We, in our house know our President is Amazing. He is Awesome and the Head of Our Nation. We, in our house Support Our President Trump!"
While the crazies are concerned about a single word. President Trump is ready to announce new accomplishments that will better our country. Keep squawking!
I think non national security related meetings should be public. We should see how our elected officials are acting on our behalf.
I really hope there's a proctologist present today at your physical so they can find your head. #shitholepresident
"Yes, You should definitely start recording them. The Dems want you out of office by any means necessary."
It's REALLY  sad that the media has to make stuff up and call that news. We need to ALL ignore them. Not worth our energy or time.
So he speaks the truth about the conditions there.. So what? If they werenâ€™t _Ÿ’© holes people wouldnâ€™t be trying to leave.
"You are  a confused president,Did you table your RÃ©sumÃ© ""CV""before Americans?That could help Americans know's who the voted!!!!"
A 3rd World country never was a paradise. This is why it called 3rd World. Offended people are just being hipocrites.
You probably should be sure you are dealing with adults from now on-that will make having a meeting more difficult to find attendees but.....
Unfortunately in today's world there's no trust anywhere you can't trust friends you can't trust family no one I would record every single thing that you do
"I know what you said! As usual, media and lying dems twist everything! They donâ€™t know that no one believes them anymore!"
"Get caught and play the ""blame someone else"" game. It's the Trump way. He can't admit to mistakes, thinks he is perfect."
"A lot of nice people live in shitholes.  Still a shithole....  Shithole is not about the common people, it's about the people in charge...."
"If you're not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.Malcolm x"
"Sounds more like liberal nonsense, just like the book fire and fury.  Funny how liberals canâ€™t tell the difference between a fake book and a book about WWII"
Record everything in those meetings!!!!! But stay true to the person we elected. That's my President!!!!!!
How sad for your soul and all the souls that still can't see who and what you are....Good people don't defend bad people.
They know their days are numbered now. It will escalate trying their best to start a race war before they are all arrested
oh right people were in the room....what was that you speaking in tongues?  fat donnie.....your brain is fried    stop lying you PRICK
Sad when Dems have to resort to outright lies instead of merely twisting words and context as they usually do....
Libtards will say anything. And nothing they say matters. Spoilt children that should have been disciplined as children.
"In some weird way, President Trump made these countries safe for Americans to travel to because they don't want to be referred as shitholes. Give this man Obama's Nobel Peace Prize."
"He says what everyone knows to be true, but because it's not politically correct he takes flack for it"
"I saw the clips and they were cut and continued to get what the media wanted. The Norway statement meant people that would  come here with out over loading the taxpayers. Not welfare cases. It was clear unless you are looking for bad.  You will always  find it."
All meetings need to be recorded given the present issues with the demos & media. All meetings. Always moles in the meetings.
"What about when Hillary called us Trump supporters ""Deplorable""  !That's prejiduce and degrading to us American citizens."
"just another lie spread by the libs, like the fake russian story and phony harrassment. the demonrats are going down in flames and are showing their desperation"
The dems will begin to see their personal life full of gossip now and people making rumors of them it's just a little gift from me
"whatever happened to journalistic integrity?  name your sources or find another story.""Freedom of speech and press, said Story (supra) does not protect disturbances to the public peace or the attempt to subvert the government. It does not protect publications or teachings which tend to subvert or imperil the government or to impede or hinder it in the performance of its governmental duties.""Gitlow v.

"Use whatever language you need to use to make your valid points. Remember your campaign promise, PC is over."
No one believes anything you say because you have been caught in lies every day.  No wonder you support Putin and his lying and computer hacking comrades.
"Here we go. Demoractics were put on the hot seat by the President on having media being present and filming the last meeting. The American people could see the true things that are said by the demoractics and again the lies that were being said to the American people by them. So know when meeting is not recordered lets start rumors and false information again. When is everyone finally going ti understand that the demoractic polictician are dishonest and trying to stop everything the president does because they are upset of the Clinton defeat. Again I am not Republician or Democrat. A independent, but if demoractics were smart form togehter and get the demoractic politician to stop lying, get them to grow up and do the right thing for our Americian citizens first. If they would just to that they can be probably respected again by most people."
"The fake news media at it again. Keep your chins up tiger. Just like Jesus says "" the truth shall set you free""."
"So, let me get this straight , you didnâ€™t say it was a _Ÿ’©hole country?? Thatâ€™s a pretty derogatory comment you _Ÿ_¡ Liar!!!"
Should have been recording meetings already. You knew all the knives pointed at your back waiting to be inserted.
People are more interested in the fact about whag Hillary did so that makes what Trump did no big deal? What a hypocrite.
"don't trust them on anything,,they would take you out of The White House any chance they get.,No deals with them,get rid of DACA ,build the wall,completely get rid of ocommiecare,no replacement,this country was doing fine without that communist garbage."
The media puts out fake news once again and all liberals are out to destroy you. Ignore them and keep on making America great again!!!!
"While i agree with what you said entirely, if you keep feeding the haters, then you better be prepared for the backlash!  #onestepforwardtwostepsback"
"Us, deplorables, know the truth President Trump... your ding a great job! Please please build the wall!"
Durbin is a piece of crap and should of been voted out a long time ago...... He has done NOTHING for Illinois!
Yes record all meetings!  They will do anything they can to make you look bad!  #MAGA Thank you for all you do!
Don't try to justify your actions Mr President. What you said can always be read from different angles. Only a man will apologize if his actions were ever misinterpreted. I don't see those qualities in you. Am sorry
"Unfortunately the republicans are saying this too!  A great man admits their mistakes!Do you not understand that you could get A lot more done if there were no name calling....no blaming of others!  The kids will not play with you if you are mean and a bully.  For our country....you must start acting like our leader!  If not, there is no respect because respect must be warned and you cannot be respected if you are disrepectful!  Sad"
"And now I been acused of theft when all I wanted was to pay for my food. But they forced me saying insisted that they would pay for it. Acusing me of me stealing that food, trying to fire me for theft. But that was my 10% deal. Like the 10% deal with God and the church members"
"It is a NWO/ZIONIST plan to destroy national identity and weaken countries. Meanwhile, occupied Palestine is for Jews only.  Think about that..."
Norwegians are trolling this and it is hysterical!  (Kinda sad for us when you actually read their comments)
"No trust from the left. But in all honesty, media should always be present and recording.  Keeps honest people honest."
"You don't leave a shithole because it's a great place to live. Whether you said it or not, accurate."
1/Dirty words are produced by dirty mind. 2/Dirty people produce dirty words! 3/Dirty words made himself the most dirty leader in the world.
Waaaaa waaaaaaa .
"Don't know how you stand it, But so Happy you can!!! Please keep going!! We the People are behind you!!! God Bless You, and your Family!!! _Ÿ’–"
"Stats for the Day--Percentage of African immigrants over age 25 with a college degree: 41.7Percentage of native born Americans with one: 28.1"
"So you meant â€œshitholeâ€ù as a compliment?  From what I have heard about your luxury hotels, thatâ€™s understandable."
WE Know the liberals are all going crzy and lies   we need our own hashtag    #AmericansDreamtoo    Fund our military
"I would record every meeting you have, vet everyone who is invited to attend your meetings and don't trust any of them."
The best defense is a  good offence  ? Still trying to  cover up the Clinton's  stealing  the earthquake  relief  Fund's.
bout time you learned you can't trust anyone with a D nor can you trust the Rs who are establishment...  Sorry but this is reality.
Question.   If it's not true. Why has no one in the meeting come out and backed you up on your statement that it is a lie ?????
The 3rd world War is on Boss! And it's taking you on big time. Record everything and create your state house media NOW!!
Higher a person to type out all your meetings. Like your surprised you cant trust anyone there? 1 spin 1 lie and cnn and all the othet fake news will use it reguardless. Be smart.
"Yes, record every meeting going forward. Then, when dems and mediatry to twist or take your words out of context, put the real contents out there for all to hear and see!!!"
Record and document everyhting you say and do Mr. President so you have evidence if need be! The dems cannot be trusted!!!
Today I wanted to pay for my food someone else insisted he would pay for it. And that's not what I wanted. I was going to pay for it using my own money
Televise EVERY meeting and show live. Put the reruns on trumptv. Be transparent. The truth will not lose. MAGA! Drain the swamp.
Oh let's tell the truth it really doesn't matter get over it we al know they are we he said. I'm so sick of the crying from the left
"Stay strong, Trump. We donâ€™t care if you said it or not. We care that our world is safer and you are bringing back jobs."
Liberals prefer elegant lies over course truth...the differences between Obama and Trump couldn't be more black and white.
MAGA!!!  The only way to make you look bad is by lying and thatâ€™s what they are doing!! FAKE NEWS!!!!  POTUS is trying to MAGA!!!!!!
"Instead of attacking our president every day, the left needs to get a life and learn what respect and truth is."
"The man says it as it is, they f*ck**g twist it to their favor. Am not American but I so much love this man."
Love that you speak your mind.  And your right why should we take in people with no education.  Australia doesn't!!!!!!
Yes record every thing you say and do for us all Thank you MR President Donald Trump for caring about the American people
"I agree, please record all future meetings so they can be compiled into a documentary entitled â€œThe Death of Americaâ€ù"
"It's all bout the reaction. CNN, MSNBC, had an emotional breakdown......whilst FOX just called it ""Unfortunate""."
"I love how the fake news hardly mentioned with the tax break Walâ˜†Trash is giving $1000 bonuses and $11 an hour....Almost nothing in praise from fake MSM ,SO SAD"
They will keep trying!  Imagine if they put this time and energy towards working as hard as u do for America!
My Friends don't believe my eyes when one tells them how powerful your organization really is.... deeply disturbing.
"No worries Mr. President. Keep telling the truth!These cup-cakes aren't used to it.End all drought with liberal tears_Ÿ_£"
What about the Clinton's and the Democrats knowing when the hurricane like them out they took billions of money they stole from the Haitians to build housing and Hillary Clinton in the dem's stole it from them deaths atrocities against humanity so it is a s*** hole because they didn't rebuild it back up the way it is was or should be. It's Prime real estate there's no reason why our country can help them more.
zionist greed expose her talmud. Her daughter got married in Israel to zionist Soros scwhartz's nephew
Lmao at studid
Dems are doing most of the crying and twisting what Trump says...Guess what get your tissue cause your gonna need it...
"Its  amazing how  people criticize others for supporting our president, yet they  stand with democrats and the Clintons."
"U think it's wise to record every meeting from now on because the Democrats will do anything, even lie, to discredit you."
"It's scary to think thst ONE person walked out of that meeting, said what he said, and caused all of this mess. ONE PERSON"
Thatâ€™s all it ever takes Betty. Just one.
"You havenâ€™t earned the trust of thinking people, sir. But, agree you SHOULD record your meetings held in the name of this great country - and, go ahead and release the recordings after each meeting. If you actually become that transparent, honestly and genuinely, I guarantee youâ€™ll be happier with media coverage. Right now you give them only your insecure, narcissistic b.s. to cover - of COURSE you donâ€™t like it. Only YOU can change that! Open all meetings & record them!"
Even if he did say it at least he didn't funnel money intended for the Haitians to the Clinton Foundation.
Yes all meetings should be recorded and more open. Let the American people hear the discussions and negotiations
"YES! Record all of them!  What a great way to put this ""fake news"" controversy to rest!  OPEN THE GOVERNMENT!"
"You did say those things donald. Many people are saying it, you know it, everybody knows it. Believe me."
They should be demanding that Bill Clinton and Daddy Bush give the money to Haiti they stole. Haiti is indeed a very poor and troubled country and even more so since the earthquake.

I wouldn't trust them as far as I could throw them. You know that sir. They will stick you in the back whenever they can.
GUNS AND BIBLES ... but you know I love and have great relationships with conservatives. I am not being derogatory to that group
"The solution, Mr. President, is to simply record your meetings. That way, people can't accuse anybody unjustly."
"The bad will always try to destroy the good, keep going strong, we now have a president that cares about, â€œwe the peopleâ€ù."
"God bless and we know you direct your attention to those in charge, not the people.....They SUCK the LIFE and WEALTH from them til they bleed no more!"
So much focus on every word this president says. How about fcusing on al the good he has done. So petty the Trump haters.
"Mt. Trump speaks well of the Haitians. People want to feel, they have a stake in running their own country.."
"Don't argue with these LIBTARDS, you are wasting your time...Buy food and ammo, and get ready for the purging that WILL take place..."
Yet another ploy of Democrats to put a wedge between Blacks and the Trump-Pence administration. sigh!
Haitians speak (3) languages.Few Americans speak Proper English.Cannot Spell either I have been Noticing.Good And Bad Everywhere.
It is a s...hole country!  What's the problem?  It's too bad the poor people living there can't fix it!
Yes the Clinton's took all the relief money and keep what was donated to the foundation. Her brother in charge of the Haiti project. Go figure. Its Haiti's gov. to blame.
"""I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians.""  Is he for real?  There's just no end to the lies this man espouses."
"You should.  BTW, thank you.  You give us hope we haven't felt in a long time.  D.C. is a toilet that needs to be flushed.  Do it.  We got your back!"
"Record all meetings President Trump. It's called cover your A$$!  They look for anything to try & hang you! We love you!"
I stand with you Mr. President 1000%. The Democratic Party are a disgrace to our nation. Pure and simple.
As reported by washington post....another of the lying corrupt papers...I wouldn't belie ve anything this rag puts out
"Mr. President, we pray for you everyday. Keep up the good work. Maybe stop tweeting!, God wants you right where you are."
"Reading all these comments just affirms my conviction that there is, indeed, no hope for humanity. None."
"You should never meet with funny boy Graham, Jeff Flaker and Demo Dick Durbin....as they are crooked !!"
all of the people condemning him must spend their vacation in one those countries...that includes all of the msm reporters.
"And we all know you didnâ€™t steal billions of dollars from them, rebuilding infrastructure guess where that money went."
Really love my President! you think and talk just like me Thank you for loving America and we know your heart is in the right place no matter how they spin your words
Yes please record EVERYTHING! Makes things simpler! Them fools wonâ€™t stop until they win!  Keep up the great work! _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
It would be wise to have everything recorded so there's no room for twisting your words.  Say it like it is!
Ignore those who try to bring you down Mr. President. Just keep up the good work and make this country Great Again.
Itâ€™s democrap propagsns as Bill and Killary promise them during earthquake but they donâ€™t do it. Where  is the money.
zionist hillary who wanted to destabilize Iran for Israel and Russia
Yup clintons took hundreds of millions to help haitians and bailed out her buddy who wss trafficing their children on a bus. The haians said tjey never ever saw help form obams or clintons. Msm making up a bull shyt story yet again bring attention to crimes commited by HITLARY
"Mr. President I am so sorry, and disgusted no President has had to endure what you have. Just know we the people know how much you love your country. You certainly did not have to take the challenge of making America great again but you did. You dont sugar coat, You tell it like it is. Many regards and blessings to and your family"
"With President Trump, he will regain their trust. Clinton's committed the biggest sin by doing them wrong. God bless America, God bless President Trump"
"Mr Pres please help the Hatians, they have serious resources that need development!! It can be better than Dominican rep."
"It's not about the words. We all knew he wasn't a politician, all polished like the elitists. He's a good man with America's best interest."
We trust you president Trump.  We do not trust the slime ball socialist democrats at all.  And quite frankly even if you did say something like that...who the hell cares?  Sounds like a pretty accurate statement to me.  Just quit trying to play fair with these treasonous vermin the democrats.  Full speed ahead President Trump!
"There are some Republicans who repeated what the Dems said so, maybe you should record all of your meetings"
"Donâ€™t explain yourself to them. You are our President of our Great Country, thank you for doing the right things."
We believe you Mr.. President! If the dems refuse protect our borders you will be left with no alternative to enforce our immagration laws.
We hired you because we wanted someone who was direct enough to drain the swamp. You are doing that and we thank you :)
And not afraid to say what needs to be said. An honest man who doesnâ€™t believe in political bs.
Amen !
"So glad that through all this controversy, you are focused and determined to make this a safe and great America again."
"Give the left what they deserve, nothing. No amnesty, no Daca. Use the executive order every chance you get. Itâ€™s on!"
Stop. Durbin was there. He's not gonna lie about it. No need to start recording meetings....it's already been done.
"Whatever you said  , well , you are known to speak the truth.....God Bless the President of the United States of America."
"I lost hope for the humanity of this time when this ""clown"" took over the most ""powerful"" nation on earth."
"We believe you Pres. the Left is very hateful,spiteful and contemptuous! Not a very nice group!! En masse. . . Keep up the GREAT work!!!!"
I guess after all this time he wonders why they cant get their countries in shake with added income from USA all the time.
"If an outright derogatory lie is told, sue the one who made it up. Youâ€™ve probably got a few great lawyers."
"This fury of the left is ridiculous.  Some countries have a preponderance of crime, poverty, violence and corruption, along with citizens who are steeped in leftist idealogies that are hostile and not compatible with Western values.  We, as a nation, ignore these facts to our own peril."
"Why are people so quick to bash trump for doing his best to help America when they said nothing about how Obama gave our money away to other countries who paid nothing into our taxies and to robbing us of all he could trump came into the biggest mess that we have ever seen he is doing a fantastic job cleaning the swamp , I have been saying for 8 I wish trump would run for president and I would vote for him and I did and I will vote for Donald Trump again"
Out to destroy you and to take the attention away from crazy Pelosi remarks about the Four White Men working on DACA. Ignore them
Good idea and be careful who you allow to participate in your meetings.  Lots of Rhinos running around in the WH.
"We as humans who believe in right and wrong, donâ€™t need to discuss that Donald Trump called them â€œ****holes.â€ù Instead, letâ€™s focus on what makes them designatable as such. What makes Haiti a place so bad that people frequently leave there for America? What about El Salvador? How about any African nation? Is it that America is the most desirable place to be? Thatâ€™s part of it. The larger problem, however, is that there are many, many internal problems within many of these countries that make them incredibly difficult to live in."
Wake up people! You can use the media for your benefit. While they are looking at all the tweets etc Trump is getting a lot accomplished and they cannot see it.
"Recording might be in your best interest. But Democrats, media, and even some Republicans would still twist it."
"What a narrcissistic man child you are Trump. Deny, deny, accuse. That's how children try to get out of things."
hahahahahahaha  TDS
Why delete your comment Jami? _Ÿ˜‚
"Who said anything about them? See, Trump supporters are so obsessed by Obama & Killary that you think if I oppose Trump I must support them...WRONG TRUMPTARDS!"
I would record everything if I were you......you can't afford to trust anyone in a world where  hate is so powerful.
"You publicly called their country a shithole. And you are planning to send Haitians who came here as refugees, worked here LEGALLY, paid taxes here, and tried to rebuild their lives here, back to Haiti. WHY???"
Don't worry Mr. President! We know that you want a better world and of course a healed America! We're here praying!
Hey Mr president Trump one thing I would like you to do for Are Congress if they run out of money by the 19th and they have to go home and sit there cuz the government shutdown they shouldn't get paid for sitting at home when they return I know if I go home from work and I don't have no time to cover it I don't get paid same thing goes for them keep doing what you're doing I believe in my heart that you're doing the right thing for this country make America great again
You don't need to apologize or make it clear once again what u said..... You were right and accept that u said it!!!
"For all the Liberals out there, Hillary Lost, and also if you look real hard you can find a Lama to pet !"
Amazing how Democrats will do Anything for illegals. They need to be reminded that they work for US. Americans
Donâ€™t listen to the haters Mr President Hillary is gone and they will smarten up as you rebuild the mess thrown in your lap You had and have my vote anytime
"Durbin made up that statement, cause trump turned down his lame imergation plan...trying to put pressure on trump to approve his or dems. lame imergation plan....# knife in the back.go trump"
"Yes,  all meetings with Dems should be recorded!  They keep proving their willingness to make things up / lie."
"Even if he called the country a S***hole, he was referring to the government that steals all the money from the people."
"This is Mr Trumpâ€™s ridiculous and wildly inaccurate rant about the new US Embassy in London: â€œReason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for â€œpeanuts,â€ù only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!â€ùFirst of all, Nine Elms isnâ€™t exactly a â€œbad neighbourhood.â€ù Secondly the decision to relocate the US Embassy was taken long before Obama was anywhere near the Whitehouse... Itâ€™s been happening for decades. The old one isnâ€™t fit for purpose in the 21st century. Thirdly, the chances anyone wanted Mr Trump anywhere near an opening ceremony are vanishingly small. We all know why heâ€™s scared to set foot in London: Heâ€™ll be roasted by demonstrators. The staff there must feel like they just dodged a bullet after being roundly slagged off by him. It must be getting hard trying to dream up spurious reasons not to agree to being interviewed by Mueller. What an endless source of diplomatic embarrassment. Can you even begin to imagine how much the new Embassy would have cost and how much real estate theyâ€™d have had to destroy if theyâ€™d decided they were going to stay near Grosvenor Square in W1A. They allegedly sold it for Â£500m which isnâ€™t exactly peanuts. Itâ€™ll cost that again to convert the building to luxury flats and recouping a billion in the London market Post Brexit might prove quite trickyTiny trump!"
No trust is right.  Evil will lie cheat and steal from u trumpster.  We know the truth . Keep up good work and i pray that god keeps giving you the strenghth to fight and do his work. Lets just hope dems dont get back in white house and destroy our country.  Im voting trump 2020
Me too ! Trump 2020 !
"Sirry, but i wonder if we can trust the dems on anything. Guards up when it comes to negotiating legislation with them."
"The media sounds like a bunch of 2 year olds stamping their feet lol. ""You called me names _Ÿ˜©"" lol. Get over it."
Finally a President unafraid of being pc. Finally a President that is for America. Finally a President that cannot be bought.
You are a disaster gone wrong.  No integrity.  No ability to decipher up from down.  #embarrasingAmerica
Dem's are backstabbing SOB's.Its not having any ill affect on your voters.When will you learn they cant be trusted.
And the very reason he tweets and doesn't give interviews to be twisted and sold to the highest bidder for mutilation!!
Of course you have a wonderful relationship with Haitians!  The Dems just want to lie and make up stories.  We are on to them!!
"They're just mad they lost a rigged election. Killery was guranteed a 2106 victory, back in 1994. Research that one."
"If its such a great place, why are they coming here to live.   We know the dems put this out there.  Fake news always"
"Yes, record everything you say publicly! These Dems are desperate and they'll do anything to stop the President!"
You said it Donald. Everyone knows it. You don't even have the guts to admit it and choose to lie about it.
"Those countries are shitholes, and we are tired of supporting those that come here. You said what millions of Americans feel, Thank you."
"I'll say it then, Just like I heard Haitians in my neighborhood say."" it's a S...hole, that I'll never return to""."
I have been to Haiti and worked in Haiti. This country has always been ravaged in disease and violence. Every person that took charge of this country took the money and ran. Very sad. The majority of people are good and are struggling.
my sea or your country sea maybe different because us here hasina related family but i have no family it's that for hasina or modi any system with try to kill me ...
No need to explain your self Mr. President America knows just what you are talking about and you are absolutely right
Dems are all liers . They can' t say anything about the great results in economy so they try to dreate scandals .
Demos trying to stir up trouble again since nothing else has worked on their behalf!!! Killary has all their money.
"Whatever you call third world countries doesnâ€™t matter, what matters is that we change our immigration policy to be one of merit and that we addresss every single illegal immigrant currently in this country. Weâ€™ve got too stop illegal immigration, no more catch and release, no more lottery, no more chain migration, no more illegal immigrants, period. Speed up the process, justmcatch and send them back, why the hell do they get a court date???"
"Hello, d earthquake was in 2010, enough time to recoup, make money from working or WELFARE and leave, if working they r taking JOBS from Americans"
And yet President Trump still wants to â€œnegotiateâ€ù a deal with the dems over DACA!! _Ÿ___Ÿè»â€çâ™€ï¸è_Ÿ___Ÿè»â€çâ™€ï¸è_Ÿ___Ÿè»â€çâ™€ï¸è_Ÿ___Ÿè»â€çâ™€ï¸è #NEVERTrustTheDems
"Well when people repeat that when they didnâ€™t hear you say it, itâ€™s called bearing false witness against your neighbor"
Well they are shitholes.  He is totally correct with the words he chose. He's just a normal guy not a trashy politician.
"The Dems say you said that because they have actually already ""taken them out"" and want you to take the fall for it."
Saying we need to be like Norway should have made the socialist Libs happy .. everyone praises Denmark
"We need to insist the FCC do something about this false reporting.  LAW:  Broadcasters may not intentionally distort the news. The FCC states that ""rigging or slanting the news is a most heinous act against the public interest.""  The FCC may act only when it has received documented evidence, such as testimony from persons who have direct personal knowledge of an intentional falsification of the news. Without such documented evidence, the FCC generally cannot intervene."
They are SHITHOLES or their people would not risk it all to come here#noappologiespotusyousaywhatwefeelprouddeplorablemaga
How Dems is it going with all that money raised to help them. When they needed it.  Especially the Clinton foundation
What you allegedly said is far from wrong! Why else would immigrants want so badly to leave their home countries?
Really Peter Heck. Cant imagine why your parents gave you a name that people use as another name for a prick...lom
The dems are getting desperate. Fake news ain't working so now they are fabricating lies to try and overthrow Trump.
Constant stabs by the left.  You've survived worst matters.  God is with you!  Just  another bump on the road. :)
"The word ""cesspool"" is appropriate when referring to places such as Haiti, Mexico and parts of Africa. Unfortunately, in later years it also now applies to some areas in the US. -G"
who cares media making big deal about something they say all the time.   dems are phoney liers   and the media is so full of garbage.   sick of the
"Monday you trusted Lyndsey Gramnesty ,Jeff Flake and the Democrats led by Dick Durban. What the He'll did u expect."
I voted for a President I thought would be honest !!  I expect the President to be a person who tells it like it is. On the other hand you can elect a liar. We have all seen how that has worked out for our Country!  #MAGA
"Yep. Record all meetings, and have everyone sign a agreement. If they blab, they can be sued.  No press."
"I'm sick and tire of most media (except Fax) they span round every word Trump say, even alter the videos!"
Bottom line is immigrate here if you have something to offer our country...not just being a welfare case for the US Taxpayers to support for a lifetime along with your extended family that you can drag in....time to end this BS
why not just annex these countries and since democrats love them so much you can appoint them as govenors . imagine pelosi governor of el salvador .she would be great  . oh yeah the left wants this daca deal done for permanent votes .    mr president : We say no way jose. they need stand in line and earn it
"We don't have to ""spin"" anything, Anthony James, He does these things to himself, No brains, no class, Just dumb"
I believe you didnâ€™t say anything like the word s$$t. Itâ€™s not your character. Sounds like one of us would say it
I'm surprised this post hasn't been deleted yet given that the senators that were lying for Trump got ousted today.
Don't worry about this tactic by the left to throw you off message. They pick and choose what offends them. Your base is firm and fully support you! Trump 2020
"Remember when you said you were smart to not pay federal taxes, and then denied it? The whole world remembers."
"I doubt you would fair any better on the world stage... AND, it is irrelevant.  Had the Clinton Crime Cartel not kept the Billions in donations that was meant for Haiti, it would be a different place.  But, a comment made years ago by a business man utilizing current tax policies to keep/invest more of his money is the point YOU made.  Well done."
"No, he said it during a presidential debate. If youâ€™re okay with that, YOUâ€™RE the sucker here."
"Albert C. Price , I'm most certainly OK with it!!  And why not??  He followed what the tax code allowed him to do!! Smart man!!! You can take anything out of context if you want!?  But by doing that, WHO'S the sucker now??"
Sucker.
Just so I have it in perspective: Everything Trump says is true and everyone who says he is lying are themselves liars. Correct?
Is it possible that youâ€™re a white supremacist?
Donnie... dude... you are going through dementia... only possible excuse for the ignorance and lies you spew
Stop including those that seek to destroy you! Obama wouldn't even allow republicans in on the meeting with the unions! Remember? Are these meetings classified? If so you should seek action from legal counsel! Let me suggest Trey Gowdy! Us sane people know exactly what you meant by your comments and so do the liberals but they spin it! Yes maybe time to protect yourself and record every word they say! #Trump2020!
President Donald J. Trump I would make sure you have a team of people who know how to keep information from your meetings private.  It's ridiculous that you can't trust people on your team. Seems you have people in your inner circle who want to bring you down.  That is NOT good for you or ou country.
Liberals wouldnâ€™t be liberals if they didnâ€™t lie. Lying and whining are the corner stones of their movement.
Then explain specifically what countries  you ment were poor and you wouldn't need to come here anyways
We understand what you meant. Keep up the good work. The media and apparently ILSenator are doing the dirty work.
every time something positive happens there has to be those jerkwads that pull something out of their butt to undermine it
"In the fake column, this tweet. I believe Durbin when he recounted your vile and hateful statements. #notmypresident"
"Have always been a lot of stupid liberals, just now they can do it on an epic scale with social media!"
"Yes, please do record all future meetings. It is impossible to trust a person w your record of lying."
Quit responding to people spewing lies. Use your energy for good. Sticks and stones may break my bones...
News Networks are using your name only for audience gain Mr. President.  Don't mind them fools and keep on putting back to work everybody in the the whole wide world.  #LonglivePresidentTrump _Ÿ™‚
"President Trump. Get off Twitter. It cheapens you, and it demeans the immense importance that IS your job."
"It's a shithole. You can say it. We all know. Hey, perhaps we can send the Clintons with a bunch if money to clean it up.  Oh, wait a minute......"
All you do is lie. No one believes anything that comes out of your mouth. A big joke! Thank god I'm Canadian!!!
Maybe Haiti wouldnâ€™t be such a shithole still if the Clinton Fundation sent them the money that was raised.
"Am Ugandan,I believe one day I will also be president of Uganda.The United States President. He is true teller hate him or not he is what he is a unique character.truth be. We Africans should better our countries period. Thanks POTUS."
I still trust YOU & GOD! I don't trust ANYTHING the lying media says! You're MY President!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
"Given your proven track record of lying, why on God's green Earth would any sane human being trust you?"
All dems know how to do these days is lie.  I would be surprised if a democrat ever won another election.
"Yes, please record meetings. You can't trust anyone. We can't trust them either. They are out just for themselves."
Then shut up on the derogatory comments you make to people !  No excuse is gonna make you look better !
Since the democrats are on tape this week with trump and they all said we need border security they needed a way out from dealing with daca
"Now come on, you can tell us the true facts, Don't lie again, remember your stomach gets larger when you lie."
Great idea. You should videotape every meeting you have and every encounter. It would be fascinating viewing I am sure.
"Past presidents have recorded meetings and phone calls. Why shouldn't this president record every meeting, phone call, and conversation he has?"
"Yes record your meetings we want to hear it, would IT inhibit you from unleashing your filth out of your shithole! LOSER"
HUGE TROLL  ^^^^^^^
Nixon got in trouble for taping conversations and now it seems Trump needs to do it just to keep people honest!
"Nixon didn't get in trouble your taping conversations. He got in trouble to spying and using federal agencies to do it. Johnson recorded almost all of his telephone conversations and most of them are available to the public."
Proud to be Canadian each and every day. Good luck America. With infant trump at the helm your going to need all the luck you can get.
"That is why we elected you. You say what every other person is afraid to say, but secretly thinks. Not another politician, Trump 2020"
"Denying your witnessed actions will not change the truth ""Sir."" With all due respect, You are a proven LIAR."
"After this mornings show of F&F , wondering if they're wobbling over to the left ? Thoughts ? Or is it just me ?!"
The latest Fox News poll shows that only 38% percent of Americans think you are doing a good job. Is Fox fake news now?
I believe President trump is right about the news media on how they are in turning words around in his speeches.
Mr.Trump God created all us equal no matter rich no matter poor don't think that you will be buried in heaven
"The media and the democrats twist everything, and their followers suck it up and run to their safe space. Sad."
"So you are calling the other several people in the room who came out saying you did say these things, ""LIARS"", right?"
Hahahahaha!!! Donny boy with a guilty conscience feels the need to explain himself as the president of the USA.
You got jobs back in here should check how mush fraudulent payment of FUNDING an Grant's that have increased has well
????///
"It's like this Mary companies can get grants from the federal government if the new hires .meet requirements like criminal history if they are or homeless but something started to show has if ones the federal grant is received ,,, volotery quitting seam to be what's whated from the company's,,,,that's way they can rehire  a replacement an do the same grants on them , because it's not a termination on the companies part  ,"
"It's ok, you said what we all are thinking...you can't trust the swamp...they'll drag you down in their muck..."
Don't let these lib criminals win!  Start recording all conversations with them.  THEY ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED.
News outlets suck people let's face it. They are control companies programed to put out certain messages. They are here to warp your mind.
If the shoe fits...go there and see how living conditions compare to the United States. You'd be surprised.
"Never heard you said ""take them out"" but I did hear you said they all have AIDS and come from a shithole country."
"""News"" being fake again... tough! but the supremacia of media has finished. We already know you are unreliable!"
All meetings should be recorded because the liberals will continue to make up lies to try to destroy our country
"Really who cares, we need to kick out all illegals and consentrate on the legal immagration policy's"
"Please, feel free to record them I'm sure Mueller would be very thankful for you making his job easier"
"The Clinton owe them money to rebuild...make them pay up, help those Haitians dig out of that Shithole"
Why would I believe anything the lying democrats say.  Give me proof and facts otherwise your just spouting lies.
"I'm sure there're recording you President Trump so if you did say it, they would be playing the tape by now!!!!!!!!!!"
"If you have no education, IQ of 20 and 20 kids America is the place for you. Democrats are the best.."
Best at being lying thieves. Ask Haitians what the Clinton Foundation did with the billions. Or Hillary's brother how he got his hands on Haiti gold.
Yes start recording them...and then when they come out with this bull you can just hit rewind and play...
Liberal democrats are bullying the President.  They are bullies.  What do you do with bullies?  Call them what they are.
YES!!!  Record the meetings you lying piece of garbage. And release tapes of the meetings you have recorded (Comey).
He once suggested there might be tapes.  Remember when Comey said he'd hope there were tapes. Maybe he'll make money after his presidency putting them on pods.
"It's a shithole, thanks for not only being you but being honest and leading our country try to prosperity"
"Recording the meetings sound like a good idea. It will certainly prove the Dems are liars. ""Lyin' LibDems"""
Maybe it wouldn't be such a sh%# hole if the Clintons would have put the money that was supposed to go there _Ÿ˜¡
Record them. Unfortunately you have to waste time like that to prove these pathetic media leaches wrong.
"Funny the liberal media keeps adding countries to the list that ""sources"" claim he mentioned.STOP THE LIBERAL INSANITY."
Record every word you speak when any dumbocrat is nearby. Maybe that will stop their despicable behavior.
We donâ€™t listen to the media anyway President Trump.  We listen to your tweets directly from you.   MAGA_Ÿ™è_Ÿè»_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸âœùï¸è

"Hey Big Papa ..they are non-producing countries.. Leach's, bottom feeders just want, want,want...Real Shitholes"
If you are going to lie about something you first need to make sure there are only Republicans in the room.
"Bonespur, your Republican appointed decorated war veteran is coming for you. MAGA...Mueller Ain't Going Away. ;)"
"They just keep throwing their bull crap at you, sir. But truth can't be shouted down. Any rational being knows what you were saying. And the Fake News race baiters can't change that. Keep up the good work!"
#Movingtotheright. Dems moved too far left.  Falling Democratic Party. Pelosi crackers nothing left but crumbs_Ÿ™ƒ
"Maybe you did or didn't. The true strength of your words can be measured on how many Americans willingly want to go to those places and not go as part of some ""Relief"" project. Ha ha ha. Those countries have paid for all of their bad choices and lack of even basic leadership. I am pretty sure I'd never want to go to Haiti, Africa or any place in central america. Sorry, no. There is a reason all of those people are fighting tooth and nail to come here and it's not because their countries are so great they'd want to live in America to have a harder life. Other countries need to improve themselves, too."
The more that people knock you the stronger you become stay yourself Mr President you are a breath of fresh air in a putrid swamp.
Every country been f****** us over for so long now we got a present who isn't putting up with that b******* anymore
"Just the libs flavoring your words to their ignorant likening. Most of us have your back, continue on!!"
"You ARE our President, and that is a fact!Haters must accept that fact whether they like it, or not!"
He works for us... so we can fight to keep our freedom. We can help ensure he doesnâ€™t get the oligarchy fascist regime he has wet dreams about! That IS our job.
"Why are our billions of TAX EXEMPTED Clinton Foundation tax exempted donations offshored to Qatar? Why are intl trillionaires wreaking geoengineering biowarfare, starvation, inflation-debt crime, AND exempted from tax contribution to build anything, including a wall? Just curious why Comey is still at large."

Don't take the bait!!! It's a shithole. I know someone and his family from Haiti :)!  Great folks ..... his name is Andre Berto he's Welterweight champion boxer and his Father is mixed Marshall Arts champ! Hey weren't the Clintons supposed to help the people of Haiti ....for a long time now !? Well anyway that place is for the most part is a dump and they probably need some nice people to buy them some plumbing.... poor kids. PERHAPS that is just the tropics? When We MAGA maybe we can then Afford to help HAITIANS  too :)!
"I donâ€™t know if believe you.  Can you tell me more of this family, please?"
Yes perhaps.
"His dad has mixed martial arts kick boxing school in winter haven  i think it was called tiger something if i remember correctly his brother worked at the kick boxing work out school also a rental property home in winter haven. We were going to lease for a year.  he started train with his dad and a younger fellow great guy and kind wife both mid thirties she had dark hair, his was blond that my brother was supposed to train with but my brother had some other personal matters he had to tend to. . Mike Berto stopped training with him I don't know why  .... also .his father is a very sweet person! The whole family is very kind, and extremely polite ...actually you almost wouldn't think that they would have become world champion pro fighters but they did and they are and I'm glad for them because it could not have happened to nicer people !  They earned it !!!! :)!"
The libs and the dems don't like President Trump telling it like it is.  Bottom line.  That's why he got elected.
No need to worry Mr. President. The majority of Americans stand with you. You are the Greatest President Ever.
"Mr. President, we don't believe anything these people say about you - don't worry - we have your back.  The people."
I trust Trump's every move cuz his every move is backed with valid reasons that are against the greed! Trump up!

Thank god for you Donna
Thank you dear President for standing with people in Iran trying to overthrow their tyranny . God bless you
Wasn't the Clinton Foundation supposed to help the Haitians??? Where did that money go. We all need an accounting of where that money went.
"Don't worry about it. Just look what how the DNC cusses at their rallies; and don't forget Biden with his ""this is a big F'ng deal""."

"â€œSince the immigration reforms of the 1960s, the U.S. has imported poverty through immigration policies that permitted and encouraged the entry and residence of millions of low-skill immigrants into the nation. Low-skill immigrants tend to be poor and to have children who, in turn, add to America's poverty problem, driving up governmental welfare, social service, and education costs.â€ù"
Well there are some shithole countries.  A plethora of them.  I agree.  The argument he made is what many think.
While I normally go to bat for Donald I don't actually believe he has good relations with the Haitians
Even if he did say shithole. Everyone says this stuff behind closed doors.  Trump has no filter.  MAGA
You need a secretary to go in the meetings with you and she can tape for you whilst she takes notes.

#fakenews is claiming you called â€œshithole countriesâ€ù. As you can see from FB most of your supporters agree. We voted for you because we are tired of the garbage reporting of unicorns and rainbows. We have plenty shitholes within our own country and Iâ€™m sure youâ€™d call them â€œshitholesâ€ù as well. IF you even did in FACT call them that. #stopsugarcoatingbullshit _Ÿ˜‰
Canâ€™t wait for you to be removed from office. The truth is coming for you Trump.  Behind bars is where you belong
"No need to defend yourself Mr. President, your actions speak louder then words. Keep up the good work."
"Dude, good policy, very  poor use of verbal skills. Have someone speek fo ryou if you need, it is bad sometimes."
Always a bad apple among us. You do so much and care so much.We appreciate all you are doing. Stay strong.
I wonder if America has qualified Dr's who can't see that they have mad president in white house Donald J. Trump
One day you push nuclear button and you make a tweet not me it was my hand...be adult and stop this satanic game.

Could President Trump have some form of dementia....denying saying something may mean he does not remember saying it.
I wouldnâ€™t worry too much; half of us donâ€™t believe the rumors and the other half knows what you meant.
In these days to have shithole nations is no excuse except corruption. I was in India in 1980- shithole nation continent.- cholera dysentery hepatitis - I did not het the first two - there are shithole nations for which people flee to USA - so tell the truth - hate is corrupt shithol nation not on my bucket list - tell the truth changes occur- the most slandered attacked POTUS in modern history who has done more in one year than previous POTUS in two terms
"maybe Haitians would be doing better if the Clinton Foundation have help the Haitians to rebuild their country ,"
Exactly instead of sending the income to Israel and Russia
I do not think they sent money to russia they got monies from russia for selling uranium  an cigar man for speaking engaments over in russia
Thank you Mr. Trump for clarifying - I know you never meant what was implied - keep up the great work - Thank you
Love that President Trump says it as it is! No need to sugar coat or beat around the bush. This is exactly what the USA needs as a leader
Said the fat no job parent. You live in a shithole state.
"They are always trying to make something out of anything you say to discredit you, we are still behind you 100%."
"Debes controlar tus formas y tus palabras. Tienes que ser mÃ¡s inteligente que los que aprovechan cualquier acto tuyo para atacarte y descreditarte. Los que estÃ¡n enfrente aprovechan cualquier situaciÃ_n para lanzarse como cuervos. Tienes que ir por delante de los demÃ¡s y no dar pie para que ellos te despedacen utilizando todos los medios de comunicaciÃ_n para desprestigiarte y crear una muy mala imagen tuya con el fin de quitarte del gobierno y asÃ_  continuar con sus planes maquiavelicos. Es por esto que debes de cuidar mucho tu comportamiento cuando estÃ©s en pÃºblico porque piensa que cada movimiento que haces y cada palabra que dices es analizada al milÃ_metro. No des motivos con los que ellos puedan justificarse. Intenta ir por delante de los demÃ¡s. Analiza con antelaciÃ_n como debe ser tu comportamiento en cada acto con el fin de evitar este tipo de crÃ_ticas. Y si es necesario contrata a una experta en protocolo para que te oriente en este sentido."
I remember your early meeting with patients they were complementary and everything was a okay that time
You said nothing wrong. We believe in what you are doing. God is in control and with you all the way. God Bless
"Yeah right, you are turning this country into a, using your type of wording, ""shithole of a country"". Now that's not derogatory, is it?!"
"Itâ€™s the mission of the democrats to twist everything anyone says into something bad, just like an x-wife!"
Speaking the truth counts for nothing good unless you are politically correct...so tired of all that!
I feel sorry fÃ¶r the Americans with such a President usling such a language when he talks about Africans.
I feel sorry for ignorant and mentally challenged liberals.

"Hmmm, who do we believe? Ya, not the one who has lied  on numerous occasions, since taking office. Pathetic!"
"Keep telling it like it is.Why do you think millions of their people risk being eaten  in the shark infested waters of the Florida straits on rickety rafts or jump on the back of dangerous trains or climb inside the wheelbase of airplanes to reach the US?"
Mr. President my advice as I also tell a friend or two . Itâ€™s best for you to just smile .. Blink and nod .. let some one else do the talking
Maybe you were talking about the animals in Chicago.. Funny how the reporters go to Afghanistan and Iraq but won't go to Chicago and talk to the troubled peopleï¸è suffering in the war zone here in America. Thought you were going to help these people? Just saying ..TRUMP 2020 and Beyond. BRING IN THE TROOPS.âù£ï¸è_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡_ï¸èâœ_
That what you get for hanging out with Democrats.  They hate you and will say anythind to make you look bad.
OMG ... Why the hell don't they shut up. Go to work. That's why they were put there. Petty s**t ... Ignore their trash tactics. MAGA _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
"Mr. President, I have been an ardent and active Trump supporter. However, you were elected, in part, to â€œdrain the swampâ€ù, not turn it into a cesspool."
"I as an American, Iâ€™m proud of you Mr. President for having the courage of becoming our president even through all the media bias, fake news and harassment you had to endure in order to help the American people. Your accomplishing this while maintaining a business and raising your children is a marvelous achievement. Your determination to reach your goals has been admirable. I'm sure your wife (Melania), who has been your chief supporter, she must be very proud of you. You are a good role model for our future generations. God bless you and god speed for the pit falls that lay ahead of you. An appreciative American!! After all is said and done...Trump will be known as the Greatest President ever. Polls and haters never have and never will dictate history ...Trump's accomplishments will triumph and history will embrace it"
Please do record EVERYTHING! - Then it will also be clear those that still support you are complicit and not just duped!
I believe you 100%  and I know that if you had said those things you would be doubling down not denying.
"Haiti is a shithole, no need to explain, and just remember, anytime there is even ONE filthy Demoncrap, they will twist your words and intent, they are the true enemies"
Don't worry about it President Trump we know exactly what you ment! Democratic party been lining their pockets for years with Foreign countries money that comes in but never makes to them !!!! Use the money to make America Great Again !! Because these poor countries are going to need a strong country
Yeah be careful the pussfied cry babies are always looking to cut your throat Mr president. #mypresident
"Maybe the Clintons should be brought up again, we could raise big money to help them and just keep it!"
MAGA....keep up the awesome job you are doing and do what you have to do to protect yourself...we stand by you!
The Left is totally unhinged if this is true and will sink to any level to undermine their opposition.
"-Linda  Reese  Walston ,   The  media  and  the  demos  must  get  great  joy   quoting   you  differently ."
What the cupcakes don't understand is their messiah took Haitians for a ride Her and her foundation . Trump 2020
"The truth butthurts demoncraps, no worries Mr. President KEEP MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! Much love President Trump!!!"
"God bless you Mr. Trump, anything you say, the snowflake dems will go against you, the truth hurts...."
"There is no trust in Trump. He said it, he knows he did.. He lies all the time, and he has half of America brainwashed and believing the greatest con ever pulled!"
"And the other half is brainwashed in saying he should be impeached. Instead of rehashing on CNN what he said about these countries, why doesn't CNN report on real news like the ongoing scandal of Clinton paying the Russians for a fictitious  Dossier to discredit him and his aides? She was preparing a coup and It makes Watergate look like child's play. On the other hand, he is not the first President to call things by their names: how would you call countries whose governments are so corrupt that their people are thrown in a quagmire of overpopulation and poverty and the only solution is  to get out for a hand out from other functioning democracies? Shithole is the right word."
"Why is Hillary even a topic, what does she or Obama have to do with Trump, nothing. So to say that there the news today is silly. If Hillary was president, that what I expect they be reporting on. But she is not and she Def wound not been a better president, they both sucked. Trump is a bad politician, he has no ability to be presidential. His actions and destruction of the American language proves this daily. The polices, the protections, the chnages Trump supports, I support majority of those. It the man I don't like, didn't like him before he was president, always thought he was the scum of the planet, over entitled and a disgusting human being.. His presidency hasn't chnaged that at all. By not changing, cleaning up his act, unfortunately that could be the greatest loss thr rebublican party ever seen. If he manages to make it 4 years, and things go badly, it will be another huge setback for the party. The only thing fake is all the social media, see there is no vetting of anything on social media, it not news worthy. So every tweet, Facebook post, etc by Trump is fake news as well. So what left to believe in.. The only thing left is what in your heart and the love of this country. Forget the news, the social media.. It all bias and it all fake news. I respect none of the above!"
"I already knew they would twist the words, so outlets like MSNBC with Lestor Holt would drum up some b.s. either way Mr. PRESIDENT has mine and my family's vote!! TRUMP 2020 MAGA!!!!"
"Laurie Adams better than what we have had in the past. I like the pot stirred everyday just to hear all the crying.  So funny , keep it up Mr. President.  Lol"
Actualy you was reffering to uganda !!! thank you for calling a spoon aspoon not a big spade i loveyou #Trump
Washington Post sites unnamed source.  Letâ€™s simply ask the 6 Senators who were there. Letâ€™s get   6 direct responses
"You do understand that sentences have subjects, right? The rest of us learned that around the age of 8."
Yes record them all or go live....since the Fake News do not report and let us decide..Keep up the tweets
Doe not matter.....they would just change the definition of the spoken word....good luck My President.
"Let NOT your heart âù_ï¸è be troubled Mr. President...LibTurdâ€™s have no other plays in their playbook, except for slander, Lies, Deceit...,_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸"
You owe no one any explanations. We elected you to shoot straight and speak the truth. These third world dumps ARE shitholes. That is exactly why people flee them. Dems are too soft and effeminate to admit the truth.
He should from now on announce all meetings are private and he is the only one authorized to release to the public
Yes you should because there is evil people out there! Love my President every day I thank GOD you won!
Ok how about not caring.and worry about our vets and elders.leave the man alone so he can get something done
"Mr. President, I support your policies and your position on 90% of everything that you do and will continue to do so. I am loyal to you. But please stop the BS!"
I think he should tape his meetings. Then we would see who gives him a hard time and leaves America out
I hope he gets what he wishes for and does record future meetings. Of course he's just talking out of his a**.
Why would Norwegians whose basic needs are already provided for by excellent civil laws want to immigrate to a shithole country like the US?
"Don't worry Mr President, we have our popcorn and are watching the fake media show and the snowflakes melting."
Better yet invite to every meeting that does not contain national secrets. Transparency is a good thing.
You are a liar.  Your relationship with Haitians is to have them work at your golf clubs for a very low wage.
You are losing your battle with the media the American people believe anyone but you because you lie constantly.
"Lmfao compared to past administrations, this man is as honest and straightforward, as it gets"
"Seriously heâ€™s not losing, he still has my vote #MAGA2020"
"The Russian crime family is going down, his white trash supporters will be sad so sad. :)"
"Only idiots are the white trash who supports him, the world and 2/3rds of Americans hate him, the only hold outs are America's white trash"
I Knew you were going to be targeted when I saw you sitting next to Dick Durban at that televised meeting.
"I am curious to know who started the Haiti rumor last night. Are the Democrats that stupid in their strategy? Are the horrible actions of the Dems in Haiti less awful somehow than what is going on or getting ready to go down here in the US and they want to distract the Libs? Or.. Has someone on our own side taken a match to the kindling(with something that can easily be cleared up  with a simple explanation)?? You know, just enough to draw the eyes to where the real problems truly exist?"
I was wondering the same thing.
"I guess since he's been so truthful thus far, we should just take his word for it.  Pshhyeah, right!"
Fatimah and Bong: this is why Eileen 's advice to document all evidence is so important! _Ÿ˜¶_Ÿ˜œ
"You said it! They are sÂ_Â_Â_ holes! Dems need votes, and they can't get them from the high tax states their from!"
"So much for trusting and working with the Demorats. To the one, real creeps and liars. Let's make 2018 their demise."
You should record every move they make they obviously have secrets from Obama they are hiding drain the swamp
"They don't take care of anything, they need to clean up the garbage they have first, then learn how to take care of what they are given."
Where's the Haitian gvt. in all this? Shouldn't they be helping their citizens rise up out of poverty ?
Ok so what goes on in presidential meeting is private and secret so the democrats committed treason they should be fired and charged with treason .
They are! Where's Clinton big money to help? In their pockets. Government corrupt. Pitiful Hillary and Bill. They are so poor.
Keep up the good work!  No DACA amnesty!  No anchor babies!!!  No chain migration!  Dont lose sight of the prize!
Do you know president Trump is gradually victimizing all americans overseas due to his unjust remarks
"No need to explain yourself, even with the liberal #FAKENEWS spinning like crazy, I knew what you meant."
"Mamboleo no I will never visit that shithole. Sorry not on my bucket list. You are a shithole because of your government, sad. Maybe on â€œsurvivorâ€ù."
"Gee, and with someone with such a track record of honesty, Iâ€™m sure I can take your word for it. /sarcasm"
"I am 100% for this prÃ©sident ,,but i wish stongly he stop tweeting in order to stop feeding the media ."
Stay on track Mr. President how can they keep letting people take from the American people we have family to raise ourselves we need our own earnings we work for .... DRAIN THE SWAMP they got rich through politics they need to go
Need a leader like you in oz.. we are desperate for a leader. Much love from Australia. I worry about our future xxxx

Others in the meeting state that they do not recall the President saying that. Durban is known to be a fabricator!
Love it just comes out and clears the air with FACTS first president ever who goes right past the BS to the people
"Those Countries are shitholes. I ran away from it. That is no secret. This is why they all come here. Their governments are corrupt. No water, no electricity, no fuel, no roads,no sanitation and no JOB. Poverty everywhere.  We know what you meant. Keep doing the good job you are doing #maga"
Mr. President it is a shame you have to even think of doing such...this is getting to be ridiculous...
"Heck need to make sure Crooks don't EDIT those too. No one believes these crooked News Media , or Career Politicians."
"The haitian government are the ones to be taking care of their people if their country was that good no one would want to leave so who ever release that tape yesterday should be prosecuted because am sure the president did not know that they were if they had his permission fine, but if they did not they should be found out and band from future meeting he has a right to say in private what he wants without someone doing what they did..Its all wrong."
Trump was right to say shithole.    this is good litmus test to oust people in government that dont love this country.
Never trust a Democrat. As to the answer to your question.... Read Jennifer Palmieri's leaked email.
"Don't sweat the small stuff, Mr. President... you are the best thing to happen to the USA in many, many years!"
"LBJ is on recording saying ""just give them.... and we'll have those ni**ers voting for us for the next 30 years"""
Lose the sissys within your meetings that whine leak and are crybabies. Referring of course to sissy durbin
"Mr. PRESIDENT, stay strong Sir.  The devil is a lie and he's using the democrats because they are Godless people."
I want to say if God put out in office and you keep on doing bad  trust God will take you out of office ...Amen.....
"Durbin the blabbermouth, stirring up shite when we in Illinois have citizens and businesses leaving our state."
Once again you are lying! Senators Graham and Durbin know what you said and have both commented on it.
"Funny thing... The screaming media won't ask someone who is from Haiti , who now lives in the US, "" why did you leave Haiti?"" Most will say "" Haiti is a shithole"" ."
"While the left commence to name-calling, I'd like an answer to your question.  Why do we take in all these people from substandard countries?  Why not Norway, or from other countries with more compatible cultures?  What is the left's and globalist's obsession with flooding western civilization with third-worlders?"
"I don't trust the democrats and very few republicans. I do trust our President, Vice-President, Sarah, Huckabee Sanders."
"Funny how the media ignores what Hilliary did to those poor Haitians.  Yes, places like that are shitholes because of corrupt governments.  Third world governments that starve and kill their own people to push their own agendas and line their own pockets are shitholes.  The media needs to stop with the political correctness, all it does is hide what truly is going on in this world and prevents us from actually acknowledging issues for what they truly are about."
"Disappointing, but not surprising that many here continue to support Trump, regardless what he says, does, or how badly he reflects on the ideals we say we stand for in this country.  To all those Deplorons I say, what is wrong with you?  Were you raised by wolves?  Have you, at long last, no decency?  Sad."
Clearly you need to record ALL coversations since Democrats are desperate and will say or do anything
"I think Vincenze Fox said it all, in his response to your shithole comment. I concur with his conclusion."
"hmm, tough salty language during a negotiation, really, big surprise?  Again, pot's calling kettle's black."
Haiti might be much better if the Clinton Foundation actually spent the money rebuilding like they were supposed to after the earthquake
People arenâ€™t blank slates that can be reprogrammed simply by being in a new country. Importing random people from the 3rd world is also importing 3rd world-tier crime rates and IQ.
"I never heard what he said so I don't know the exact words, but is the assessment about those places being talked about wrong?  This is our problem with immigration is that so many of these countries are so far below us in economic status and quality of their leadership that people are desperate to get out of there and come here.  I am glad to welcome those people into this country but they must be willing to add to our society and we must be careful not to overwhelm the system with tremendous one sided immigration rates, or we will no longer be the bastion of hope.  It is better, when possible to raise up these people's home countries, but the elite there often prevent that."
"Several Decades back Swami Vivekananda started His maiden speech in America with ""The Brothers and Sisters of America"""

Funny how the same people upset by President Trump calling Hattie a sh&+ hole yet have no problem aborting babies.
"and we don't believe a single word you have to say. One year later, and you're still talking about Hilary."
And yet the Clinton foundation around the Haitians to pay for Chelseaâ€™s wedding. But nothing was said
He never said anything bad about the people..but hey the truth is that country is piss poor their own leaders wont tale care of then
I commend you for being honest and if that struck a nerve with people GOOD.  Grow a backbone America!
"Close the borders.  PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!!  No more international flights, cruises or trade from any country."
"If your country is wonderful, you stay there continue to live in the country and make it better. If itâ€™s a sh**hole you leave and mooch off America. Itâ€™s happening all over the states and everyone knows it. Why is everybody afraid to speak the truth."
"Lol you are kicking them all out of your country, forcing them to flee to mine.. ya, wonderful relationship."
"Sounds like there are some rats in these meetings, quick to run back and start trouble.  Nobody likes rats."
"PLEASE record all future meetings. BTW what happened with those ""tapes"" you threatened Comey with last year?"
"I'm disappointed in Dick Durbin for blowing the whistle on the president's statement if it's true. My gosh Illinois can use all the help it can get, why would he burn bridges for 5 minutes of headlines."
"Well we all realize that most people are not traveling to those places for vacations  for a reason,...."
We all know it was bs. These people are pathetic they didnâ€™t get what they wanted so they made up lies about you. What are we 12 so sad.
"President, ignore them please and keep doing the good work you are doing to Make America Great Again"
Lol..are you serious or just sarcasm ?
"Micheal Opeyemi Ige I am serious. Like Tunde Adenuga said this morning, before we condemn DT, lets look within. You are dirty, and someone called you dirty and smelling and you are angry, he is only stating the obvious. Fulani Herds men are killing freely, not one is arrested, can that happen in an organized society? Appointment dead people sounds insane to me. No disrespect bro, but we just got served"
"Lol..well, you just said the obvious but however, someone like Mr.President that generalizes can't be taken serious either, can't you see that he's such a loose cannon."
Let's build our house then we can defend it. President Donald J. Trump is just a practical man who says it as it is. He refused to go to London to but the ribbon fot the new US embassy cos he deal was a waste of money. $1.2b to build an embassy?
I get you but it also doesn't change the fact that he takes every chance to show his disgust. He's a divisive leader and he's good at sowing discord. He's also very disrespectful and arrogant but not his fault. It's the fault of the shithole African presidents that have sold us  cheaply.
Micheal Opeyemi Ige Now you are talking. As you lay your bed..... He didnt insult Japan or Sweden or Norway. Middle East and African leaders have disappointed this generation. Just yesterday  i read in the new that one African leader has been voted as Life President. Isnt that 'Shithole'?
"Once again, they are twisting your words, smart people are aware, and can see through their mind set, MAGA...."

You should start charging $10.00 per car to go e into the USA. That will make them pay for the wall.
Every week another lie peddled against MY PRESIDENT! âù_ï¸è Love Trump!  Best thing ever happened to America!
Trump has zero credibility in the US & around the Globe.  He is an embarrassment to the US and represents the very worse characteristics of a minority of those that live here.  How sad that Trump (the person who condemned our past President for apologizing for the actions of our country) is now the very person providing a reason for our Country to apologize for the actions of the current President.
"Hahaha of course you deny it. Better yet, just cry â€œfake newsâ€ù like you do about everything else lol."
Democrats continue to twist the truth...keep going because America is listening and We the People DO NOT LIKE IT!
"Yep, crazy like a fox! You keep on Mr. President. I don't care who doesn't like me for backing Trump!"
"Fact is most Haitians are witchcraft. Satanist. Like Ca, ,change way, changes outcome. Like L.A.  Wicca all the way."

They were very quiet when the Clinton crime family foundation pocketed the Haitian relief fund money
I just cannot imagine the horror those pure minded people in that room suffered.  Just think if he used a real expletive that is used so many times against him. GASP!!! SPUTTER!!! COUGH COUGH!!! WHAT HE SAID!!! They'd have all passed out.  Maybe that would've been a good thing tho'.
Perhaps you never did. But after one year in office you have offended so many immigrants and nationalities that it's difficult to keep track. You have established quite the reputation for being THE MOST OFFENSIVE PERSONALITY ON EARTH
Love The Donald and Main stream pukes will not change my mind with their attacks on Him. Go Trump !!!
Yes record all meetings. There shouldnt be any secrets from the citizens who elect all the government
"Most of us republicans know that you speak whats on your mind, no sugar coatiolng, no censorship. You soeaj just as most of us do and say whats on your mind. Many say the same thing in private. Most politicians do not have the guts to say what they are thinking. Keep up the good work !"
Theirs your leakers closed meeting with Congressional members walks out of meeting running their mouth to media
Clintons kept the money meant for that poor  country devastated.left in worse condition then before .which is worse calling it a blank hole or stealing the money meant for them to help rebuild.!....
zionist Hillary

Trump talking about the government of Haiti not the people again democrats put in their own perspective go figure
Record everything the people must know the president is for the people and is a peopleâ€™s president I have faith in trump
"They are ""shithole"" countries, nothing to do with the color of their skin, we have ""Shitholes"" here too .... Chicago is high on the list."

Your the first today where I read about Crooked Whiny Hillary.
"Well, those countries are shitholes. They have corrupt and lazy leadership. Always wanting handouts."
"Nobody believes you, because you lie all the time....just wait, the Republicans in the meeting will be shamed into confirming what you said...._Ÿ_¡"
You idiot....Get lost.
LOVE OUR PRESIDENT

Actually Anthony it IS the left who lie and twist his words!!!!! WAKE UP!!!!
"Trump contra a fake news,que futuramente haja um acordo bilateral USA e Brasil,Trump e Bolsonaro e melhore a economia do Brasil..."
"We the people support and defend you from this government Mr. President.  We have common sense and know that they are trying to discredit you and take what you say out of context and out of hand. Keep holding your head high, sir. We got you."
Make the Presidency a reality show! Take the cameras everywhere....This would be epic and revolutionary! Then Dems can't lie about something people could believe you said! I believe you could say it because I have said the same thing before....100% true! #MAGA
"I once had a customer who needed to go to Haiti, He did hire a bodyguard for his visit and that was 20 years ago.  It's only gotten worse since the earthquake.  None of those millions in aid reached the people...of course."
I'm on the fence here... Democrats and the media going crazy condemning the President for using bad language and my IRA increases almost 0.99%.   Mr President can you curse out those guys it that meeting and the media today? I want to be sure who to thank.
"Disgraceful.  â€œNo trust,â€ùno truth.  Liar, liar pants on fire.  You might as well change #MAGA to #MAWA."

Build our wall sir and demand an audit of the countries receiving aid money from us. If the tit runs dry, the socialist dems lose all hope. Trump 2020!"
Behind you Mr.President. unfortunately the evil doers will lie and claim an anonymous source stated blah. I think you need to record these types of meetings in future for your own protection. Evil is everywhere in DC esp. Media. God Bless you. I pray for you and family every am.
I don't care if you called that place a s******* or not I've been there and if you call it a s******* that's a compliment compared to what it really is
Huh... Wonder why he's not trying to defend the shithole comment. BTW norway is out of your league. Most Norwegians wouldn't want to take such a large reduction in the standard of living by moving here.
"the clinton foundation collected money from the earth quake to build homes for the people ,they live in tents still"
"Good morning you lying narcissistic moron. What a Stable Genius you are....no one shovels horseshit as good as you do. Are you rehearsing your lines for Muellers interview? I look forward to the additional indictments. But most of all, I'm looking forward to your resignation and the subsequent removal of yourself and your family members from positions within our government.#FTOMF"
"That's what I was thinking, record but those b idiots.  Please seek them out and make them no apologize to and the county"
I wish you were in government in UK. You would soon sort out the cretinous Mayor of London Sadiq Khan
The Clintons should have helped Haiti instead of stealing their relief and maybe they would have better conditions.
"oh we already know that Mr President!! the Russian collusion is going down the drains and they need a new scandal to attack and destroy, we already know their dirty corrupt games and what this party has become and is capable off , it's just to bad that so many fall victims to their hate!! By all means you should record everything in the future for your own protection! it's sad that we are at this point, but you can't trust anyone !"
"Trump recording all meetings would be Mueller's dream come true.  Cult followers: Please continue to encourage him to record all meetings.Signed, America"
You are not speaking for me
There are many things said that should not be said. Actions are what is important. No man is perfect. I would focus more on the man/woman who do real harm to our country or it's people. The Democrats are not saints either. The list is long there.
"Look, in a heated, closed door meeting with sitting senators, I get the President calling sh*thole countries, sh*thole countries.  It's closed door.  I'm sure other presidents have used similar language across the table without someone running to daddy screaming Donny said this, Donny said this."
"No worries. The Dems have been lying to their own for years now and have been lying about you since before day one. Not one single sane person with an IQ above an earthworm believes anything the Dems, mass media or Hollyweird says any more. The boy who cried wolf has more credibly then they do..."
"Dems want to malign nothing else , their agenda is simple undermine his reputation and achievements."
"Peter Heck who care what he said or didn't say tomorrow when you wake up those countries will still be ""shitholes"" and Trump will still be your president."
"If you have to defend yourself all the time, your behavior is questionable.  One, two, maybe even 3 times you can claim people are lying on you...but everytime...change your behaviour and tactics."
I know that fake news media can try so much to stain your image with lies and blackmails but they can't destroy you or stop your shine my dear President Donald J Trump. Stay stronger Jah will never let bad men put you down.
"When I hear Haiti, I think of blue ocean, fine sand, palm trees, and the perfect place for a vacation. What happened to this place that you would call it a â€œshitholeâ€ù?"
I believe you are thinking of the DR side.
The Clintons happened to Haiti
"Doris Gendron-McCue, please tell me more. I really would appreciate it."
"I have been there & it is a shithole!!! They are coming here for a free ride, period... And yes the money stolen needs to be tracked & those who stole it need to be in jail!!!!"
Haiti wouldn't be a shithole if the Clinton's hadn't stolen all the relief funds.  Only 5% went to Haiti and they kept the rest...that's a FACT!  Even used that money for Chelsea's wedding!
Chelsea got married in Israel to Zionist Goerge Soros Schwartz's nephew. A complete American traitor. Her ties to Putin must be investigated too. Iran is no threat to the globe
These third world countries have suffered from corrupt â€˜leadersâ€™ for decades.  People are in dire need of a Trump kind of leadership!  The Clintons have robbed them of donations instead of Haitians benefiting from them.
Iâ€™m a very proud republican that served our country on active duty for 22 years. I have lost confidence in your ability to lead America.  Your rhetoric and tweets and now your most recent insulting comments display your lack the understanding what leader should say.  You have demonstrated your lack of skill sets to lead.
"Your Excellency did you call my Africa Continent a 'shithole'? i need your loyalty, trust & sincere answer.thank you."
"Mr. President, I am one of your biggest supporters. I am a proud woman, who became a single mother after my husband deserted the family. For years, i refused to be on public assistance, but my dead-beat ex husband is not paying child support, despite a court order. The child support enforcement is a joke! Please do something to restructure the child support system. This will lower the number of single parents that receive these benefits. It is not ok for some of these men to have children that they do not take care of... They are getting away with murder, Mr. President. #MAGA"
"Speak the truth, that's why we voted for you. You have our full support. TRUMP 2020!!!!!!!! America first."
"#MAGA2020  the left care more about what you say, vs the Clintons stealing the Haitians hurricane funds. Typical of the pathetic, vile LEFT"
"Well, YES you should record all meetings with low life politicians from both sides...shame on you for not doing that for the last year....just keep doing what you are doing, WE all benefit for MAGA."
"We know how they are, but Iâ€™m just so glad that you stand up to them and speak truth against the lies"
"You are such a disgrace, shaming your nation. We always knew you lacked the capacity to do the job but the depths to which you have sunk have shown you to be far worse than anybody imagined."
Liberal demons will do anything to twist words. Be very careful because they all go out pouring in and go out and make headlines to everything. They will bring you down as much as they can. They will drag you to the highest point.
"Sure, MULTIPLE independent fact checking groups have documented nearly 2,000 lies you've told since the election.  Yet this time it's the truth, and once again, someone else, everyone else, has to be lying.Scientists lie, Gold Star parents lie, Democrats and liberals lie, the media lies (except when you like what it says; then it's the truth), surveys lie, academics lie, everybody on the face of the planet lies but you.Pathetic."
The Clinton's were to blame for much of what happened to Haiti.  We know that you prefer to MAGA with immigrants who desire to be here for a better life who will support America!!
"Recording all meetings is an excellent idea, need to cover your back Mr President. Everything you say is twisted into untruths. We stand with you. TRUMP 2020"

"Mutual trust, understanding,  and confidence are essential parts of first consideration to enter into any mutual contact. Unfortunately,Breach of trust,now a days,is adversely affecting ethical values and dividing humanity,because of devil   education system."
"In a different perspective, poor countries are simple result of their bad and corrupt leaders,. The population face lack of freedoms and persecution. They live under fear of retaliation. President Trump, in my view, was frustrated at the attitude, the corruption, dictators, the wickedness that exist in those countries, not the population who are suffering!  President Trump is setting an example of true unveiling governmental corruption. Many international countries' population are coming out of the darkness, pouring into the streets, boldly challenging their leaders because they also feel like in America, they had Enough with poverty and much labor. Progress was not in their horizon; it would continue, if they keep being silent! Of course, MSM blocks Americans any daily real international news which support the movement President Trump started. The return to human values!"
"Well i for one believe u - i know that u dont need to say a word to have media say that you did. Besides - personally, I agree that there are in fact nations that are shitholes - its true and i also value truth no matter how much it may not be so sweet !"
Hey Lyin Donnie....no one in the meeting has said Durbinâ€™s Lying...how come none of the others in the meeting have denied it?
"Democrats act like their the ""sainted"" people!  LOL!  This is just another lame attack by the Left!  They'd rather report sh*t like this instead of all the GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENTS President Trump has done in his first year in office!  Trump/Pence 2020 <3"

What get me is people on Face Book has said worst things and I the ones that do it is the Obama and Hillary supporter . May be they should say any until they can control their own language .
"Actually, Trump has raised our status in the world, Hillary.  Obama, bowing and apologizing, made us a laughing stock!"
"Except it has zero to do with race. It's about working countries vs non working countries. Besides, isn't abandoning your country of origin the greater crime?  I'd rather be insulted and acknowledged than abandoned and forgotten."
"We need more people like trump for presidents, NO MORE POLITICIANS thst only care about lining their own pockets!!!In 7 more years Trump will have fixed all the damage Obama,clinton and bush did all together!!"
"Even if he did say the country was a S***hole...it kinda is, and the operative word here is ""country""... the people taking hold of this and running the race card yet again, know exactly what they are doing. VERY DISHONEST."

32%? Whereâ€™d you get that number? CNN? And whatâ€™s disgraceful is the way the criminal politicians are trying to oust him before they get caught with their lies to and theft from the American people. Which includes turning Americans against each other with their lies. Evil will deceive you to get their way. And itâ€™s not one party thatâ€™s doing it.

"Everyone is acting so outraged over this truthful statement.  We know how it is in these countries, that's why everyone wants to come here."
All of your lies and insults are routinely recorded by the media or someone and you deny you said them anyway. The problem lies with you.
"Such a liar. And all your sheep supporters and trolls bringing up the Clintons again,  as if their wrongdoings justify yours. Pathetic, SAD"
"Great work POTUS on jobs, houses, debt, jobs , immigration and most of all for continuing to fight for us every day working folks as the Democrats work on the next treasonous scam (suing big oil) thus effectively ruining the economy as it's what backs our money.I pray it won't be much longer for some of the Dems to wake up but it is quite a challenge.

There is now no denying that Baron is running Twitter and Facebook for daddy. Everyone else is employed so why not him too.

"Yes, you definitely need to record every word you say.There are enemies in your midst who are looking to take you down.Thank God you are stronger than they think! Keep up the good work!"
"Washington Post CANNOT name a source once again, and CNN running with the story as true.....FAKE NEWS! Washington Post owned by AMAZON....BOYCOTT!"
I really don't care what he did or did not say! It is so refreshing to have a President that does not give out sweet words then  disregards the United States Constitution to do what the ILLEGAL ALIENS want done!!
"You are a congenital, baked into your DNA, LIAR...Iâ€™d believe Dick Durban before you anytime...by the way, could you show me a picture of the F-52 fighter plane you said we sold?"
You should NEVER be in a meeting with dimocraps and not record it.  Their followers are low-information sheep that will believe anything they are told by their leaders.
Maybe you should record your meetings. Evidently the media and the Demoncrats can't get it right.  They will do anything to discredit you.

The only good Democrat is an unemployed Democrat.. And since they will stop at nothing to ruin the presidency if I were Trump I WOULD be recording EVERY meeting with EVERYONE! Trust NO ONE!
What do you mean an unemployed Democrat??
fire them all!

That's so weird that nobody would trust you.

Angela Dawn Nope he wouldn't. The TV lies to you honey.
I donâ€™t think it was â€œtake them outâ€ù that made everyone mad. I believe it was the sh!thole comment. But youâ€™re too dumb to realize that.
The Dems want everyone distracted so they will forget about all the corruption by Democrats in DC and across this nation.
"We know how they work, Mr. President.  The democrat traitors say far worse about the flyover states anyway.  Every time they speak, the hypocrisy flows like a waterfall.  Totally untrustworthy people."
The fact that he unloaded like that in a meeting shows that he is unraveling. Most of them feel that way but wouldnâ€™t actually SAY IT.

It is disgraceful for you to be the one signing the proclamation today. You are making our nation more of a shithole every day.
I know the Haitians don't want the Dims back in their country after the Clinton crime family stole their disaster money.

"Rocky, you should be more upset at The Clinton Foundation for stealing millions from Haiti.  What are your thoughts on that?  Or are words more damaging??"
Is there proof? Where are the indictments?
"But there is no evidence that Hillary Clinton, through the Clinton Foundation, raised ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" for a hospital that was never built. We consulted groups that have been critical of recovery delays in Haiti, but they could not point to a specific Clinton Foundation-funded hospital project, either.""We've tried to figure out what he might be citing as well, but we can't provide you with a source of his claim because one doesn't exist,"" said Craig Minassian, a Clinton Foundation spokesman. ""The Clinton Foundation never committed to build a hospital, nor did it accept, raise, or spend funds for that purpose. His claim is false."""

"Of course however, here comes the libtards pretending to all of a sudden care about the Haitians despite not giving two shits about them when the Clinton crime lords screwed them for a ton of cash."
All this controversy because one guy; Dick Durban said you said something offensive? I think this shows that democrats will stoop to any means to discredit your popularity.
Sounds like a slander lawsuit. Time for the Democrats to stand up for the crap that comes out of their mouth. I would sue every one of the lying pieces of crap Democrats.
You should tape everything. You lie as much as you breathe.  Your cult can see the real you. A disgusting POS.
Zionist Trump and his Talmud must be exposed

Look at the ovrall picture and Trump is actualy right..would be nice to have a balance of people from around the world...One has to look at the context of entire meeting..The racecard came out fast on that one..
"you said racial quota..my point ,,,You Libs make everything into a race thing to fit your narrative. I don't buy into the first posting of the news before I condemn someone, especially from the bias socialist news networks..Not one Democrat has said yes to fix our country for over a yr...some bunch of losers they are...The country is doing great..get past the hate...try to imagine Hillary in there, what a nightmare that would of been..."
"I would record also, so these haters get caught on what the good you are trying to do for the country !"
Mr President is time to cancel the embargo against Russia. It does not serve the protection of Ukraine and it is the best way to help the European Economy
"Trump is right!, no matter how he said it!..We are not the world's ""Salvation Army""!.The liberal frenzy about the term $hithole is a distraction from a booming economy and growing evidence of conspired treason by Clinton and top FBI officials that had an ""insurance policy"" to subvert our election.."

Trumpkins will believe Fat Donnyâ€™s â€˜shitholeâ€™ denial. He counts on his rubes. Theyâ€™ll believe anything he says. I count on that too.
You canâ€™t trust any career politician... They are all against you and your agenda... Start recording now!!!...
So tired of the devil attacking our Godly president Trump enough is enough y'all claim you know the truth but you all ain't preaching it
Trump is Jewish his grandmothers last name is Kolber
"I would record all meetings, just in case. And you may have to weed out the spies you have in these meetings."
"Thank You, President Trump, for having a strong passion for the well being of the USA and it's citizens."
Social media team is doing damage control. That team needs to be held accountable for all the false propaganda they create. Judgement day will come!
The Democrats are just trying to fabricate stories that contradict what the live coverage of your meeting has proven
Even if you said it ... how is it smart for democrats to negotiate anything constantly throwing dirt?
Yeah I know a lot of those shitholes it's been f****** us over for years are about to get their welfare check cut off
Trump has lost any credibility with actual thinking people during the Obama admin. Who in the world would believe him now or EVER?!
Many trust and believe him.
Yes Brenda Davis there are many ... unfortunately those believers would believe anything this vile man says while suspending any ability to think critically and see he is and has always been a self serving ignorant fool. They are in a cult as it were!

Iâ€™m thinking the meetings need to be taped. It would maybe keep everyone honest about who said what.

Considering the smear campaign that is going I would suggest you videotape every conversation. They are out for your blood Mr.President n it's sad that they are not even willing to give you a chance to prove you can do a good job.

"1-12-2018Dear P. Trump, Pope, and all, especially our world leaders, Regarding to our Immigrants, wallsHow we solve? Send more good ones to lead, teach, mission them in their nations as Haiti, Pakistan, Vietnam, Myanmar, China, Africa,â€_even Mexico, USA, â€_.as we have done before, as our Saint Marguerite from France to Canada, please. Today is our St. Margueriteâ€™s day (1620-1700), please read, and why we should read?     ""God closes the big door and opens the small door,"" that is the phrase that people often comfort themselves or others when they are disappointed. This is true of St. Marguerite.    Marguerite was born in Troyes, France, but his life in Montreal lasted for eighty years. She is the sixth child in the family of twelve children. Your parents are virtuous. He was orphaned when he was nine and Marguerite took care of them. When he was twenty-seven his father died. Now, everyone in the family has grown up and Marguerite thinks that he has a vocation to become a monk. But the joining of the Carmelites as well as the Friars Minor Clans failed. At that time, the Governor of MontrÃ©al was visiting France seeking teachers for the New World. He invited Marguerite to Montreal for teaching as well as teaching catechism, and he accepted.    Marguerite divided property for brothers and sisters in the family. They do not believe that you dare to abandon a civilized country to a wilderness far from the ocean. But he did that and landed in Canada in mid-November. Marguerite began building a chapel in 1657 to honor the Mother of Perpetual Help.In 1658, he opened his first school. Recognizing the need for teachers, he returned to France in 1670 and brought six other friends to Canada. All these brave women became the first Sisters of the Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary.    Marguerite and the nuns helped the colonists survive the famine. They set up a vocational school to teach young people how to build a house and farm. The Order of Marguerite also grows. In 1681 there were eighteen nuns. Seven of Canadians. They opened more mission centers and two nuns to teach the Native Americans. Marguerite herself also received the first two Indian women to join the congregation.    In 1693, Mother Marguerite handed over the convent to her successor. Superior was Marie Barbier, the first Canadian to join the congregation. In 1698, the convent law was approved by the Church. In the last years of her life, Sr. Marguerite devoted herself to prayer and autobiography. On the last day of 1699, a young nun was dying on his bed. Marguerite asked God to die for her. By the morning of January 1, 1700, the nun was healthy, but Sister Marguerite was fevered. He suffered for twelve days and died on January 12, 1700. He was beatified on April 2, 1982 by Pope John Paul II.    The table:     It is easy to deny that the plans we think of as God must be defeated. Marguerite was not called to be a closed-hearted nun but a founder of the Order and an educator. After all, God does not forget her.   Quote    In his sermon, Pope John Paul II said: ""... in a special way, St. Marguerite contributed to the building of that new nation [Canada], the role of women, and the need for him,  striving to train a profoundly Christian spirit. ""The Holy Father also noted that she had looked after the students with love and trust ""to prepare them for worthy wives and mothers, cultured Christian mothers, Hard work and good influence on the people around.""Yes, our Canada, USAâ€_ used to be empty, nothing, right? We donâ€™t need walls, we need TIM way. How can we build up our Canada? USA? Hope you can see through via this story from our St. Marguerite, as many Saints. How can Africans, Haitians, all can learn the right worship, democracy, all good ones, if they donâ€™t have change to TALK ( T), INTERACT (I), MISSION (M) WITH GOOD ONES? God bless us,One globe under God.We make our planet great again, dear all. Yours sincerely,"

Not one person throwing a fit would want to live there because it is horrible.  You are right on!  Dems will never quit lying and blowing it up to suit their agenda.

Take DACA of the table for negotiations. Take the responsibility of the disappointing prior presidency and do not use these young souls as pawns or puppetts of the Democratic party. Make an executive temporary order that can suggest for a future signature from Congress and Senate. Make all good standing DACA participants into legal residents under probation for 10 years and make the eligible for Citizenship afterwards. Residents normally have to wait 5 years for citizenship.

"I am surprised some people on this list haven't petitioned to have the statue of liberty torn down as leftist propaganda. Mounted under the statue are these words. Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,With conquering limbs astride from land to land;Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall standA mighty woman with a torch, whose flameIs the imprisoned lightning, and her nameMother of Exiles. From her beacon-handGlows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes commandThe air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.â€œKeep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!â€ù cries sheWith silent lips. â€œGive me your tired, your poor,Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,I lift my lamp beside the golden door!â€ù  ....

"Oh my gosh, a New Yorker used foul language!! I'm shocked to my core! Hey folks CHECK OUT THE DOW RIGHT NOW!!"
Yeah why don't you just expose with the clintons did over there in Haiti done with it
you and your staff surely don't need to go to the gym with all the backrowing that has to be done because of your sloppy mouth _Ÿ˜‚
"I don't know what Trump said in that meeting, but we know what the Clintons did to Haiti."
Boom. Real talk.
"NO YOU JUST REFERREDTO THE COUNTRY AS BEING A SHITHOLESeek mental counsel ASAP My 10 yr old laugh at you"
"Was Jeff Flake In That Meeting ???Flake Also Was Saying A Deal Was Already Done For DACA. Fact Is, He's Correct.  Get The Clinton's To Pay Back The Billions they took and get Bill Clinton off the UN's Control Of Of Elections of Haiti and Get Hillary's Brother yo give up his Control over Haitian Mineral Rights for 22 Years."
".....but...... they are shitholes... otherwise they would have a DACA program for others and free housing, food stamps, medical and education all free...for poor migrants and refugees."
"entendemos sus palabras Sr.  PRESIDENTE DE LA GRAN NACIÃ“N  AMERICANA! Usted es un gran hombre, y ama las almas!  BARUJ HASHEM!!"
"Donald theres times when you should STFU. worried about 2nd term because of your mouth, not your deeds."
Donald trump is a stack of pulpit that he did not respect the Haitian nation he should be in his family's house to monitor the dogs or the moutique.
"PLEASE start recording meetings just for proof from the DERANGED left.  I loathe the way you and your family are treated. I am sorry so many are rotten to you. YOU ARE DOING AN AMAZING JOB AND GOD BLESS YOU! THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU ARE DOING FOR US!!!!!!!WE LOVE YOU SIR, just CYA from now on. Record  everything!!!! MUCH LOVE TO YOU FROM A PROUD DEPLORABLE!"
"Prayers for our PERFECT PRESIDENT TRUMP, may our Lord Jesus Christ guide you and Protect you, in HIS GLORY AMEN GOD BLESS AMERICA!#MAGA WINNING #MAGA CALIFORNIANS FOR TRUMP!"
"Trump, you need to record all of your meetings. And why invite any Democratics to meetings anyways? Theyâ€™re there to set you up. To dissect your words and heâ€™ll even lie on you."
The press loves making things up.
"AS LONG AS THE PRESIDENT IS CREATING THE JOBS, REDUCING UNEMPLOYMENT AND PUTTING MORE  MONEY IN YOUR POCKETS PLEASE SUPPORT HIM. Just forget whether he said this or that and work with him."

Part of the reason Haiti is so poor:  the Clintons stole the money for repairs!  Where is the outrage for that?
There is outrage for that. Do you think everyone who opposes this trash-mouthed tyrant is a Hilary supporter? I can guarantee you 75% of America are not Hillary supporters -- they're people trying to save America from this lunatic in power.
"Thank you, Mr. President, for standing strong against wickedness and corruption. Praying for God to be with you! GO TRUMP !!"
So nice to see so many smart people commenting here. I have a really good idea.  Everyone that is offended by President Trump should relocate to these shitholes and get out of our great country
Amen!
"Those you don't trust you just better to leave those.a few moments after they will be your fan to trust you. Its human nature. (Realisation after100%. Crime, who will have place anywhere in the universe too thereafter...the end.) . my suggestion to let's do our work at moments and latter will come to you for a small edge at our nature. Thank you. Boss. I wish god bless you and us. No doubt my 100%. Trust on you and your family and team . thanks god. (Radhey Radhey.) Thank you. Welcome. OK."
"AMEN! I have been all around the globe and there is much Chaos abroad and we don't need to risk it here. We need to take immigration seriously, and put the American people first. If only Jerry Brown would have done same, that young woman in California would be here today. That is why there is immigration laws in place to keep the American People safe. We don't need our country like some in the EU.  Without proper national security, we have no nation to call home. Many countries where people from all the time, and I love it, however I know also which ones pose a risk to our citizens, and the ones coming here to work/relocate legally."
"I think we need to go back and remember what Clinton did to the hatians What happened to the money, why did it not all go to help the people. What happened as a result of the Clintons??? Have we forgot????"
You have to stick to your agenda. Do not let them get you off of you game. They want all of these illegals here and enough is enough. They want to shut down the government let them. They donâ€™t work anyway.
You absolutely should record your meetings Mr. President.  And I don't mean by documenting the minutes on paper.  Actual recordings.
"Thank you President Trump for fighting for America.#TrumpPence2020 #AmericasMainStreet #MAGA"

"Gosh, and  what did the Clinton's do with all the money they ""collected"" for Haiti?"
Haiti would be much better off if the SCUMBAG CLINTONS didnâ€™t STEAL MILLIONS FROM THEM _Ÿ_¬
Let the haters should keep hating we are making America great again.... But with you we can make it greater

She extorted that country like no other... horrible woman !"

""" The Clinton Foundation alone has directed $36 million to Haiti since 2010. Another $55 million has been spent through the Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund, and an additional $500 million has been made in commitments through the Clinton Global Initiativeâ€™s Haiti Action Network.But what does Haiti have to show for all of these investments? Not much, according to Katz. â€œHaiti and its people are not in a better position now from when the earthquake struck,â€ù he said. The hundreds of millions of dollars and the years of reconstruction efforts have yielded negligible results. For a project so expansive, Hillary has kept relatively quiet about Haiti thus far in her campaign. Her spokesman declined to comment on how Haiti has shaped her foreign policy, saying Hillary would address that â€œwhen the time comes to do so.â€ùhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/06/13/did-the-clinton-foundation-raise-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-for-a-hospital-in-haiti-that-was-never-built/?utm_term=.8bd40d950f4a"
what about all the girls under 14 they used to kidnap and used to bring them to little islands in the pacific so that all of the major big boys could rape them?
The ones who try to denounce that get killed
Jerry where is your proof?
zionist hillary and her Putin buddy must be investigated
The Clintons are the ones who should go down over Haiti after what they did!!
The U.S. stood for better conditions in the Revolution from Britian;  Americans put their lives on the line to win a better government.  Let these people do the same;  fight for a better governing system.  Let them work to make their country great.
Heâ€™s talking about the _Ÿ’© that is going on in those countries! THAT IS WHY PEOPLE WANT TO LEAVE THOSE _Ÿ’©holes!!!
"Speaking of Haiti, how about that Clinton Foundation.. _Ÿ˜_"
"Mr President, Haiti IS a sh*thole, and if you said that in a meeting with adults, they shouldn't be tattling on you anyway!!  I am 100% SURE other presidents said far more derogatory comments in their meetings, the difference is, no one ""tattled"" on them!  Perhaps you SHOULD record future meetings, since these people that get paid so much to FIX AMERICA, are too busy trying to make news with your words, that they don't realize THEY ARE THE ONES ruining the USA's relationship with other countries by making private conversations PUBLIC"
"To My President, whom I love and support:  Haiti was suppose to be rebuilt after Katrina.  ""Killary"" got her brother THE contract to rebuild Haiti, but after building only 100 cracker-box homes, he lined his pockets with $$$. billions!!! and left the people in worst shape!!!  MAKE THE CLINTONS GIVE THAT MONEY BACK - WE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, DONATED THAT MONEY!!!!  My church has sent two humanitarian missions to Haiti to help rebuild.  Our men gave their work boots to the Haitians and returned home in flip flops!!!  This is bigger than anything our churches can handle.  Can we do something?  Assign a sort of ""Habitat for Haiti"" to help rebuild...the churches will join you...we need a catalyst....please help.  I THANK GOD EVERYDAY FOR YOU AND ALL YOU DO!!!"
Isn't Haiti the country who spread AIDS throughout the entire world ?
No
I would love to see your flat-earth map of how Haiti spread AIDS all over the world.
Somebody should look into WHY Haiti is in such sorry shape...
You mean like someone should look into why Puerto Rico is STILL mostly without power due to the ignorance of this administration?
"Sure, it'd be interesting to see where the giant pile of money and supplies we keep sending these places ends up."
The people are no doubt lovely but the country is a ****hole.
"I come from one of these countries. Trump is right, these are not good places to live and in most cases the people are not good either."
It is a SH***T Hole country because of corruption it hasnâ€™t change in 50 yrs
"New Year Revolution for the USA = JUST SAY NO TO SHITHOLESShithole students don't get accepted to top universities. Shithole employees don't get promoted and become C suite professionals.

"If anybody wants to know why Haiti is such a shitthole, maybe they should ask the Clintons."
It is a shithole and whereâ€™s the money for Haitiâ€™s people that the Clintons stole ?????
Glad u speak the truth. Say it loud and proud....

"Frankly, Haiti and many countries just like it are shitholes.  No secret here."
"â€œThis is no longer about Donald Trump, what he said and did,â€ù Steele said. â€œAll presidents come to reflect America, our values, reflect who we are, and the question we have to ask ourselves is: Is this an accurate reflection of who we are?â€ù"
"Whats the big deal?Haiti IS a SHITHOLE,and by the way,,,,,What ever became of the $65,000,000 the Clinton Foundation poured into Haiti after earthquake?Answer:It all went to their rich friends"
Merit based immigration is what this country needs and that is exactly what President Trump wants for this country.
Call it like it is third world countries have a lot of problems and most are bad places.
But let's be honest.  Haiti is a shithole.
Please record future meetings.
We are behind you Mr President we love you and what you are doing for our country thank you
Please the Clintons are God. They ripped of the HAITI people.

Tell me again what the Clintons did for Haiti...
We should only allow people that will contribute to the progress to our country.
Ask the Clintons ( #LockHerUp ) what they did to Haiti with their mob foundation!!!
Zionist Hilalry and her ties to Marxist COmmunsit Putin must b exposed.Her Talmud and Jewish roots must be investigated too. An anti American.
Haiti is still a shithole place.  Thatâ€™s no secret
Ofcourse liberals are more mad about what you said than Hillary Clinton turning Haiti into a s*** hole. Im sick of this liberal fake news
"Trump make the snowflakes cry...Hahahaha, I love it...winning, winning, winning, winning...."
You need to Drain The Swamp Sir. These people who are leaking info from private meetings are proving to not give a rats a## about this country.
Ask Hilary's CLINTON FOUNDATION how Haiti got to be the s***hole it has become.
"POTUS, Why are we still issuing humane visas? We should only be issuing economic visas. People coming to live in our country should be able to prove they can provide for themselves and their families. They should have to sign a waiver saying they will not get any Government Assistance for at least 10 years. Show documentation that they have an education and show a criminal background check. If they can do that and can show that they love and respect our country and our laws, then fine , live here. BE GRATEFUL that we let you live here. ITS A PRIVILEGE!!!!!!"
The countries mentioned ARE shitholes. Many more now mentioned lol
The liberals make me sick with their lies
Stay strong!! The dems are mental..and will lie..cheat...and worse...we the people support you!!_Ÿ’ª
Time to investigate Clinton Foundation regarding Haiti Fund?
zionist clintons are their ties to Marxist Putin must be investigated. Expose the Talmud and get 911 reinvestigated.
"And I believe the president yet, a low IQ Worm like Robert ""the whacko"" DeNiros can have  profanity laced comments about the president in front of the whole country and liberals accept that just fine.H Y P O C R I T E S!!!!"

"With All My Heart You Didn't Say These Ugly Words....The People Who Make Up These Stories Ought To Rot In He'll For It."

Maybe if Haiti would stop their praying with Voodoo....
Umm Haiti is a shithole even they know it
And Haiti IS a sh*Thole. That's more FACT than anything else.
Hillary stole all the money raised for Haiti. Where are the headlines for that?
"Exactly, whereâ€™s  the outcry??"
Obviously saved their outrage because Trump called a shithole a shithole!
"It's a country given over to voodoo and democrats, though it's hard to tell one from the other."
Haiti IS a shithole............thanks to the Clintons !!!!
I love that our president Pisses off all of the snowflakes
He just keeps WINNING!!!!
"If the Democrats had their way, America would look like haiti in no time flat!"
We don't care if you called the country a shithole. It is.
I thought the clintons fixed Haiti. Whatâ€™s that? They STOLE all the contributions? Oh- thatâ€™s ok. Itâ€™s the CLINTONS!
Do you realize how many times youâ€™ve used the â€œeveryone is lying but meâ€ù defense?
Maybe ask Clinton for the 440 million she kept that was to go to Haiti. That would help alit
Thank you for all that you've done and all that you continue doing for our countryâù_
"It was ok for Hillary Clinton to call a significant part of the US population, actually people, not just deplorable but IRREDEEMABLE! Crickets from so very many. Look up the word irredeemable and then cry me a river for the nations who sit in the UN saying the most abominable things about our nation. Then beg for cash and more allowed immigration while they spend lavishly on vices. waste millions and live like kings and queens. Does anyone remember the UN speech using the term ""Diablo""- Chavez referring to President Bush? How about all the whiners in Congress pass legislation kicking the UN out of our country and use that money to adequately care for our veterans? How many Republicans in DC actually have the gumption or desire to say this BS about what GOVERNMENT MUST DO for others while borrowing from others to do it MUST END? Where is John Galt, I want an invitation please..."

If you are from a shithole country and you know it clap your hands.... _Ÿ‘è
Who cares what you called Haiti...I am sure it is relevant.
I thought the Clinton Foundation fixed Haiti ?
Haiti is s shithole! Worse off today because of the clintons!
The unvarnished truth! What happened with all the Clinton Foundation cash sent there to clean up all that crap ? FACT CHECK if Haiti is as 45 described?
HEY CLINTONS  GIVE ALL THE MILLIONS $  BACK TO HAITI WHAT YOU PUT IN YOUR POCKETE
"Trump I AM INFORMING YOU THAT I AM EXTENDING A PROFOUND DEEP APOLOGY TO MY FORMER GOVERNOR GENERAL "" MICHAELLE JEAN "" ON YOUR BEHALF !

"Haiti, I would not want to live there."
You remind me of my pops!  Be you... that's who we voted for!!!
He is not a lying politician and I love it he is doing a great job God bless him and our country
No mention of how the Clintons ripped off that country
"Should have issued this rebuttal immediately. Of course, Haiti is a s!@#hole"
It would be awesome if we could send all the trump haters to haiti.......
Talk to people that left these countries that came here to work.  They will tell you that are not good places to live.  Why do you think they left?
How many Democrats take frequent vacations to Haiti and El Salvador?
Why doesn't someone ask the clintons about Haiti....ripped them off too
"Deplorables knows you did not say that Mr president, we beleive u."

"We all know hiLIARy abandoned and lied to Haiti, courtesy of the Clinton Foundation.  #MAGA"
Thank the Clintons for keeping the money donated for Haiti.
Folks have forgotten what Obama did to Haiti.
Ask the Clintons where Haitiâ€™s money is
Didnâ€™t Hillary pocket herself money supposed go to Haitiâ€™s after big earthquake!!?
How about the money Killary keep from Haiti Dems? 0 Fs!
"If all the other countries are so great, why do their residents keep trying to come to the USA?"
So if he said Haiti was a great country would he be a liar? Cause it isnâ€™t great
haiti would be in a lot  better situation if  donations  dont stop at hllary fundation
"It's a fact that it's a poor and troubled country. But Haiti has great people who overcome numerous natural disasters and strive to make a living, and as president your comments like ""shithole countries"" is really undiplomatic and makes the leaders of other countries try to avoid associating with you. The United States is the greatest country, but it's not without its flaws and you, as our president, are our biggest flaw."
I think people should focus more on their jobs and less on yours!
Totally agree. Especially that disgrace of a Mayor of London.

"""Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than...""That's called an admission, folks."
"Maybe we should let the Clintons take of Haiti, oh wait."
"By the way, those countries are shitholes!"
people busy calling other countries shitholes yet theyre also immigrants..how ironic
"Haiti relied upon funds from the Clinton foundation after their devastating loss...and got nothing.God bless Donald trump."
Haiti's contribution to the world- HIV/ AIDS.
Be honest - north Africa and Haiti are sh..holes.

As a concession, a)  if they have served HONORABLY in the military, b) if they are in school (HS or college) AND HAVE A LEAST A ""B"" AVERAGE, c) if they are gainfully employed for at least a year &/or d) if they have some extraordinary talent that would benefit the US, THEN they may pursue a path to legal citizenship while residing in the US.  Just to put things in perspective -- would you or anyone you know leave your doors open and allow someone to leave their child in your house for you to take care of? --Think hard about that!  3) Chain migration MUST end.  4) the immigration lottery MUST end.  5) Our Military MUST be FULLY funded.  There's a little crazy, chubby guy with his finger on a little, but destructive, button just west of us.   There's more, but this is already long.  You just needed to know how real American citizens feel about the budget you need to produce by next Friday.  So please get to work and start thinking about us --- not your party."""
"How many of these outraged liberals who are all of a sudden ""Haitian Avengers"" are going to be moving to Haiti? Or even visiting there? I'd guess NONE!"
I know.  I spent last night going to left leaning sites on Face Book saying the truth.  Your a good man.  Please don't assume the Democrats or Republicans want to work with you.  They will put a knife in your back if they think they can get away with it.  Today I will be posting the following article to hold the mirror of hypocricy  in their faces:  https://spectator.org/importing-the-s-hole/
"Ask Hillary Clinton where the money donated to the Clinton Foundation went that was supposed to be for Haiti. This woman used the funds for personal use. Her famous words "" what difference does it make"""
The Clintons said Haiti is such a shithole we are going to keep every single cent we took up for Haiti. WTHIWWYP
"Mr President speaks the truth and I agree with him about Haiti.It hasn't got much to offer, especially to the Haitian people."
Just part of the conspiracy against you. Keep up with great work you are doing! MAGA _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‘ç_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
"No, you called Haiti a ""shithole."" Don't forget the truth Don the Con."
You're right. There is no trust. As in NO TRUST IN TRUMP.
Question.  How many people flock to Haiti to vacation or live?
More like what they didnâ€™t do for Haiti.
It was probably some low-level anti-Trump staffer
Mr president look beyond these liberals they have no potential for honesty they bring these poor people in from these impoverished countries to inslave them for their votes nothing more
"Obama himself weaponized the IRS and the FBI. Took away our healthcare and divided our country into shattered wreckage. Our president Donald Trump has worked tirelessly to turn this around, he is under attack every second from Soros and the Left. Obama at the same time trying to take credit for the economy. We were so very close to our country being stolen from within, and must fight to ensure they don't succeed."
Get the money from the Clintons and return it back to Haiti! Put them in prison _Ÿ˜ˆ_Ÿ˜ˆ_Ÿ˜ˆ_Ÿ˜ˆ_Ÿ˜ˆ_Ÿ˜ˆ_Ÿ˜ˆ_Ÿ˜ˆ
"La prensa ,perros rabiosos,no se detienen ,te quieren destruir,no los dejes,no los dejes!Se estÃ¡n ahogando en su propia sangre junto a los demÃ_cratas .Ten cuidado al hablar,nunca se detendrÃ¡n,no soportan que los gobiernes.A HaitÃ_ le pasa lo mismo que a otros paÃ_ses pobres,que sus gobernantes ,clase polÃ_tica,comerciantes,les han saqueado su naciÃ_n,robado todo,hasta las ayudas.Go trump !"
I love the fact you call things what they are! Thank you Mr President!
"Wait. Whatâ€™s the problem? Did he reveal a secret? I think we all know Haiti IS a shithole. _Ÿ_·_Ÿè»â€çâ™‚ï¸è"
If you would have called them DEPLORABLES all would be good.
Dont forget the demorats created these #shitholes ummm #Chirac #Bmore
Find out who is leaking/lying and terminate them. Don't let these things take away from MAGA.
I bet Trump's relationship with Haiti is better than Hillary's.
Prove he said it or shut your mouth.
We know trump were still with you .. Just saying what all us are thinking .. Shows your a true man ..
Amen
Clinton foundation stole billion from Haiti
It wouldnâ€™t matter if you did.. off the record should be off the record... record all your meetings
Maybe you did not.  But if I were you I definitely would have!
Only thing wrong with Haiti is the Clintons stole them blind
"We who were NOT there have no idea exactlty what was said, however, what people are saying the President said was nothing derogatory about the people of Haiti or any other country, he spoke of the countries themselves. People are so focused on the words that they miss the point at every turn. I believe bringing up Haiti was a very purposefull comment for if people chose to remember the leader of Haiti stole money designated for it's rebuilding and the clinton foundation misappropriated funds to be used in aiding Haitians. Look at the government's of the countries mentioned, while leaders get fat their citizens are living in squalor, all while asking the United States for help. Too many Americans don't choose to do their homework to know the facts because they're out there folks, in places other than FOX, so don't attack me with that one."
"Mr. President, that's probably not a bad idea"
The help Haiti needs is to be taught to harvest their own land so they can persevere
You called it a shithole country. That is disrespecrful.
It's honest.
"And yet no one is up in arms about what the Clintons didn't do for Haiti.  Bill and Hillary apparently ""own"" Haiti and have turned it into a worse shithole than it was before that earthquake.  Now, that is disrespectful."
See how many liberals want to take a vacation in Haiti or make Haiti their retirement home '
Haiti is a sh*thole country rife with corruption. No worries.
Haiti government is completely corrupt! make it your business to educate yourself-PLEASE!
"No worries, we have your back...."
Did Haiti ever get the money from the clinton foundation???? Oh wait it went to the Hamptons.
Love to see Duck Durbin Vacationing on a Beach in Haiti!!
"Haiti helped Trumps one time buddies, the Clintons, rake in a load of cash..."
"Doesn't Haiti have a very LARGE percentage of people with HIV? Yeh, we need those people here..."
"Go golf, again, and keep lying... Just remember, don't do it in front of Mueller..."
HAITI IS PROBABLY MAD AT THE US BECAUSE KILLARY & FRIENDS STOLE ALL THEIR RELIEF MONEY!!
"You said â€œshithole nation.â€ù WE HEARD YOU SAY IT. No coincidence considering today is the anniversary of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. You have no tact, class, or empathy. In fact you aggressively attack everyone just to stay relevant. One year in office has felt like ten. You are EXHAUSTING. Canâ€™t you just stfu for one day and sit in a dark muffled room somewhere with some Enya and Vonnegut and give the rest of us a gahdamb break?!"
Clintons got rich off Haiti why arnt they posting about that? The media is so one sided it disgusts me.
"OBAMA CORRUPTION WITH HILLARY AND CLINTON FOUNDATION,  HAITI,"
"Hey Hillary, where's all the money you stole, that was supposed to go to Haiti??? Hmmmm"
Calling other countries shitholes is not exactly diplomatic. Not that Trump has 1 ounce of diplomacy and his tiny brain
Know anybody who vacations in Haiti to enjoy the beautiful beaches and great food?
Thank you President Trump for exposing those lying Democrats again!
"Clintons are the ones that Robbed Haiti blind , they are suffering because of the Clintons"
"Liar, you lie on a daily basis, what a total waste and embarrassment you are."
"Yes, please DO record future meetings."
Yeah your MAGA is making country into shithole!
You donâ€™t have to explain yourself. If it wasnâ€™t on tape itâ€™s hearsay. Your doing awesome! _Ÿ‘ç_Ÿè»
"Even if you said it, I personally believe they and other countries are s***holes. My opinions."
They won't believe you.  But we who speak plainly do.  #MAGA
Dont bother defending your self.Haiti knows you didn't say it and that's all that matters.
Many people heatd you say shithole of a country.  You are only lying to doothe your own soul.
If given a choice where would most of you guys bashing Trump live?  Norway or Haiti?
"What part of saying ""shithole countries"" do you wish to change,  now?"
Mangoes from Haiti are much better than Haitians.
"Dems don't care that Hillary cheated Haiti, but call it like it is and they're all over it."
"Couple of sore loser liberals commenting here, grow up [[STICKER]]"
"Record all meetings with Dems and Republicans....the establishment are NOT your friends. Soldier on, Mr. President!"
Investigate Clinton Foundation and Haiti relief funds for a hospital that was never built!
Still we do not know what Hillary's brother is in charge of all the gold mines in Haiti?
The reason Haiti is in such bad shape is because of the greedy selfish clintons!
"Even if you did say Haiti is a shithole, you wouldn't be lying."
you cannot trust anyone on either side. record everything.
"Unlike Hillary Clinton, who's gross little cronie was trying to abduct 33 little Hatian children out of their country _Ÿ˜¡ how many times did they get away with it is my question! Guess what, THAT'S NOT CHARITY. THAT'S HUMAN TRAFFICKING"
But Trump wants more emigres from countries like Norway?  Why? Could it be their whiteness?
"My relative was a priest in Haiti road a donkey to the villages to say mass, they would make bowels , cups, platters out of beautiful wood to survive I have some, they are hard working, the US sent a lot of help when they where hit with a bad hurricane my cousin was there he helped bring food on his donkey up into the village, so get the fact's on Clinton then the earthquake hit, like Portico Rico some are still with out power, some still have no roof cover, with tarp's sit in a warehouse, people get the true fact's before throwing stones!"
Hillary stole children from Haiti hospitals
"I noticed my president denied saying ""Take them out"" but never denied the sh!+hole countries statement. _Ÿ_”"
"It is a shithole country, if you did say it, you just called it like we all see it!"
I bet Trump is planning to start a foundation and go over and steal all the aid money to Haiti.
There are some countries that really are shitholes.
"LÃ_genpresse"" (lying press) is a defamatory word most frequently used in Nazi Germany."
Problem is most Trumpanzies identify positively with nazis.
"Bob Skrak  wow, thatâ€™s terrible! No one ever thought that an intelligent, advanced people like the Germans could ever have perpetrated the horrors of Nazi ideology. But it happened. The world said never again. History does have an interesting way of repeating itself..."
America had a part in German's financial problems as they recalled loans when wall street crashed.
"Bob Skrak  yes, the hyper inflation of the early 1930â€™s played right into Nazi party propaganda re: Financial systems are controlled by international Jewery, used to exploit the Fatherland, etc. Doesnâ€™t Trump say the same things about the Chinese, Koreans, well name any foreign power I spose..."
If it wasn't for the second crash the nazis would not have had a look in. Things were becoming stable in Germany in the 20s. Berlin had become a town to go and party in.
"If Haiti and parts of Africa is not a shithole , what would be a shothole then?"
There's a place in Haiti called Hell... nuff said
In Michigan too.  Coincidence?
tell Killary &Billy boy to PAY BACK the money they stole from Haiti & put it in their FOUNDATION!
Have u been to Haiti lately?  Shithole is a compliment
"I have been to Haiti, it is a desperately poor and dirty country."
Does anyone recall the Clintons relationship with Haiti?????
Haiti is very dysfunctional and the country has many problems but it is not a shthole.
The clintons raped hati along time ago anf still are
"Haitians are just fine, as long as they stay in Haiti."
"Said both Africa and Haiti were Shitholes, and we didn't need there kind in our country."
"Haiti has it 100 times better every time USA goes there for ANYTING, they even have Walmart!"
"He called it what it is.  A very poor, corrupt country raped by it's leaders & the Clintons"
"I am shocked, appalled and outraged by Mr. Trump's  statement yesterday about my Countrymen  and women from HaÃ¯ti."
"Here's a fact. Every ""shithole"" in America is ran by Democrats lmao"
Guess you cannot trust no one except Hannity.
"Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country.In other words : a shithole"
Haiti would be a much better place if the Clinton' have given the money to them as they lied about....
Ask the Clinton's to gib back all the Money from Haiti.+
"i was not present to hear any comments. truth is, haiti is a shithole."
Reason Haiti never recovered is Clintonâ€™s looted the piggy bank that was set for Haiti.
"if not haiti,what about african countries? how were they described?"
They are shitholes too. Fact.
I notice that you didn't deny it Larry. Lol
"Mr. President  we deplorables don't care what you say. I have been to Haiti and where most people live it is a $h#@ hole. After the earthquakes and hurricanes there was billions of dollars raised to help them rebuild..The clinton foundation got rich. Her brother got the mineral rights. Their government lives in a mansion which is guarded by military carrying rifles with bullets draped across their chests.WE ARE WITH YOU NO MATTER WHAT THE DEMONRATS SAY! <3"
Haiti Mexico yeah they are shithole countries not the people but the government who runs it
"He included Haiti in his comment about ""shithole countries."""
And don't forget it was Clinton who robbed and financially raped Haiti.
Why do we have a shithole running our country ?
maybe Trump should have raised your taxes like your daddy Obama did
We don't!  Wake up!  Hillary did not get elected!
Keep on keepin on Mr. President your doin great . Hell with the haters .
what has he done that was any good for the poor working poor middle class of this country??????????????????
What have you done thats the question .
"When seeking anything derogatory about Haiti, look no further than the Clinton Foundation."
Its funny how people freak out when someone says what most are thinking anyways.
So we know Hillary is shitting herself now that Haiti is trending. That's good.
Well if your cruise ship has ever docked in Haiti you can see why you may get that impression
Haiti is STILL waiting for that Clinton foundation check _Ÿ˜‚
Do you even know a single person from Haiti?
What did Clinton and Bush's foundation do for Haiti from the money they got donated for Haiti ?
Also remember Haiti received a shitload of money from Clintons - where'd it go
â€œWhy are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?â€ù    WHY ARE WE?
"You have been sabotaged way, way too much by the Dems, President Trump!!  Sad for our country!"
We are New Yorkers we tell it like it is....I'd like to see all detractors go there to those 2 countries for a vacation !!!
If Haiti was such a great place why would they all be rushing to come here? Just saying.
Haiti is a shot hole. It's ok to tell it the way it is Sir
"You donâ€™t have to splain yourself Mr President all Haiti is doing is sending us mailers saying we won 1000,000,00 just send them 12 dollars processing fee for your money and your bank name and account so we can deposit your winnings in your account."
At most of these countries were not shitholes why they would they be dying to come over here
"Last I checked, it was the Clinton foundation and the Clinton's themselves who help destroy Haiti."
"Wasn't the Clinton Foundation supposed to make things better in Haiti?????? cough, cough.........."
Yeah. But they decided to rob the kitty instead. Priority you know.
"Iâ€™m sure the citizens of Haiti would agree that they live in a sh*thole country, as a result of a corrupt government! The exact same thing that the Democrats want to do to this country! Those of us with common sense knew what you meant!"
"you called their country a ""sh78$^$^Zt hole"" you no longer have a relationship with Haiti"
Have every meeting in front of cameras like you did with Congress.
http://www.nationalreview.com/article/437883/hillarys-america-secret-history-democratic-party-dinesh-dsouza-clinton-foundation      maybe if the Clintons hadn't  stolen the money  ..  it wouldnt be a shithole ?
"The American people know the democrats are trying everything to disrupt your Presidency. #MAGA"
"Wonderful relationship. The best. No one has a better relationship.IF IT WAS NOT FOR SELF PRAISE, YOU WOULD NOT BE SAYING ANYTHING AT ALL."
Haiti might be better off if they had the money the Clintons pocketed
The Clintons are responsible for the mess in Haiti.
This country was build by shitoles people from Africa.
Called it like it is...oh I didn't know countries are a RACE now....lol Demtards
"Be fair. The place *IS* a toilet. Not as bad as a certain country that has Designated Shitting Streets, to be sure, but bad enough that people float away from it on anything that will float, in the midst of shark-infested waters, during hurricane season, just to flee the place.Funny, all of these places that are so ""offended"" by what are, plainly, truthful remarks, seem to have populations desperate to GTFO and come *HERE*.That says all that needs saying."
Iâ€™ll tell my family working in missionary in Haiti thatâ€”Iâ€™m sure they will find your ignorance supportive.
Sherry Hon I feel for them. I spent enough time there to know what I'm talking about. I stand by my words as accurate and true.
"When the hate doesn't work, they start telling lies."
Haiti is a wonderful place for vacation
They are trying to take down our President by media
Bigger question is who leaked the info to media it was a closed door meeting
"Diane Feinstien if you're talking about a closed hearing. She said ""It was because of a cold. """
I will answer on Haiti  radio and tv
If the CLINTON ORGANIZATION took Haiti for that much money . Than why isn't the news after them
"I love what you are doing and support you. I do hope you did not lose your cool and say "" shithole countries""  hough. Did you ?"
Haiti is not a sh*thole country thanks to the #clintonfoundation
U may want to ask Haiti about their love for HC after she stole all their money!
Haiti is a shithole plain and simple
As if they cared about Haiti. The Clintons certainly DIDNT!!
Shithole...I'd rather visit a Shithole then Haiti..gross
Where's all the money they received from the Clinton foundation? Wait a second.......

"So whatâ€™s the problem here???  Haiti is a shithole.  Itâ€™s unfortunate, but it is the truth."
If the Clintons hadn't grabbed the money meant for Haiti we would not be dealing with this today.
Maybe true..BUT...Clinton's didn't put filthy words about our Allies in his mouth.
Haiti is not an ally. A dirty poor country with rulers who mismanaged help.
Did he lie they are shitholes. How many people that you know say going to one of these country's for vacation? None not one so
Trump cannot go one day without insulting someone or lying!
"Who cares, Haiti truly is a shithole but unfortunately exploitation has left the country in ruin."
"I hope that you did call those countries ""shitholes"", because frankly, they are."
Takes one to recognize one!!
Donna Thompson *Boomer response intensifies
"And, then there is what the Clintons did to Haiti."
Liberal shoul go to Haiti and show us how to rebuild!!
"Haiti is an AIDS infected shithole why should we take them in, to pay for the medical care?"
"CNN is annoying to me and I am not a FOX news fan either - The news isn't reported as fact it's dictated to us  and we are told what to think - even Trump ""Real"" news - each citizen can think for themselves in a democracy - i can't say I can support many of Trumps policies on the other hand neither a neoliberal democrats agenda - clearly Trump used bad wording to describe countries with problems but this country has its own  problems and some of Trumps appointees are incompetent messes and won't address issues of the working class or poor  - So Trump slows immigration - fine  ?  He's concerned about having to provide for immigrants or security ? Is he going to address our citizens reasonable access to  education - jobs with fair wages and affordable housing - improving urban areas - the big homeless problem -our struggling Americans ? We have poor in rural red states as well as inner cities that never changes -think about those citizens who need opportunity"
Good!  They ARE shithole countries. And who is it that says we HAVE to take anyone from anywhere??
"You know... there have been numerous articles, posts and memes, which suggest: if you curse a lot; it is an indication of intelligence, wit and good health. Thousands have ""liked"" and wholeheartedly agreed, admitting they too, use ""spicy"" words, quite frequently! This President was elected, because he is out of the paradigm, of previous Presidents. His transparency is unsurpassed, via his ""tweets"". Never has the American public been given such access to the unfiltered, unedited thoughts and ideas of a sitting President. He does speak like an ""everyday"" type of guy, where there is no political correctness, to mask a generalized comment. It is a fact that the poorest and most poorly educated countries, are those which were ""on topic"", at that meeting. After getting over the feigned shock and outrage, of certain words, that are undoubtedly part of everyone's everyday language: what was untrue about the meaning? True, there are many who have persevered and despite the odds against them: have become valuable and positive contributors to our country... but they are the exception and everyone knows it!"
Everybody knows those countries are shitholes I don't understand why we can't say it
"but it's the ""shithole countries"" part that everybody is upset about."
"Why doesnâ€™t anyone want to immigrate to Haiti, El Salvador, etc.?  Because they are horrible places. Not the people, the countries."
Iâ€™m just here to say that Africa is a continent and  not a country but carry on.
"Doug Mataconis, go move to Haiti"
Haiti sold their soul to the devil and has been for decades!!!!!!!
President Trump ...  I don't know how you do it !!  You are attacked no matter what you do . Some people want to destroy you at the expense of our country .   We the people that voted for you are so appreciative that you are strong enough to withstand all of the negative comments every day ...  Thx ...
I thought the Clinton Foundation spend millions improving Haiti!!!!
"Common misconception. The Clintons ""collected"" millions to improve Haiti."
"I was being sarcastic, but you knew that"
Then what are US embassies doing in those countries? Close them all please.
We don't care what you said...KEEP WORKING FOR THE REAL AMERICANS !!! WE THE PEOPLE ALWAYS STAND WITH YOU..
"I can say it, I don't like Haiti, nor their rude can drivers."
"I have never been to Haiti,  but I have never heard any thing good about it."
Well Haiti did give us voodoo and zombie powder so I guess we should be grateful for that.
"Your relationship with Haiti is probably as ""wonderful"" as your relationship to North Korea."
A 'turd' world country....
What has to bother anybody who is paying attention is this: My office is across the street from the White House. I saw millennial and 20 something â€œjournalistsâ€ù scurrying around on their cell phones exclaiming â€œwe got himâ€ù as Washington Post liars agreed to take the fall for yet another â€œunnamed sourceâ€ù story. This is disturbing. We have people you wouldnâ€™t trust to park your car working as members of the press. And it shows. The real sh*thole right now happens to be home to the mainstream media.
For that amount of money they could have purchased the country!!  None of it went there!
He even lies to himself. Embarassment to our country.
WE know Mr President : DONT WORRY they will put in your mouth words that U dont said it...because they want to cover up ...their corruption that democrats play ( Clintons foundation) in Haiti...it is psychologically operation to COVER UP... with your words ...THE MONEY CORRUPTION about DACA : Mr president The Judge of 9 th circuit TOOK THE PAPER WORK from U...sorry and The Judge took the paper work with it sentence from the 9th circuit FROM tHE CONGRESS ..so bla bla bla ...let him until June cover the DACA people...anyway ..THE JUDGE MAKE A SENTENCE ...so calm down ..dont let their push U around ...LET THE JUDGE DO IT..SORRY U Can not do nothing now...about DACA
How Well Did The Clinton's Treat Haiti...Digicell Really Helped Them Too. MAGA
Yes record in future! Ask Clintons where is the money for Haiti?
"â€œI never said anything derogatory about Haitians, just about Haiti. HUGE DIFFERENCE.â€ù"
Can you even find Haiti on a map?  Please oh please record the meetings.  Please.
"Im an immigrant, and i know that! Will always be stand for any homeless, any veteran an citizen. American first! You are not the only one who suffer wih the midia. At my original country, Brazil. Jair Bolsonaro _Ÿ‡§_Ÿ‡· is attacked all the time from the global mÃ_dia. Lets pray for our president! _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸"
Clinton's screwed haiti years back
"Truth to politicians is like daylight to vampires. While â€œcolorfulâ€ù from a language standpoint, whether Trump used it or not, it is an accurate word to describe these countries. Anyone that does not believe that should spend some time there. Regardless of country of origin however, immigration should focus on individuals that can bring resources to the country in either brain power or financial. We do not need to import additional welfare recipients."
My country nigeria is shuthole plus other african countries say it as it is
Haiti has a corrupt Govt and it is a $h:thole..
CLINTON FOUNDATION HAS REAPED BILLIONS FROM HAITI.
Mr. Trump. You are a buisnessman. Why don't you sell out unprofitable states like Haiti?
You've got to be the dumbest person on the face of the earth !! Oh wait !! your supporters are dumber then you Donnie !!
Stop talking to the mirror Richard ;)
Louis Botes Boy that was a very well thought out come back ??? You must be a Demented Donald supporter ?? I'm so sorry for you !! You do know when you make a mistake like supporting Demented Donald it makes you a better person to admit you made a mistake ??
Some countries ARE shitholes....those saying otherwise haven't traveled to any of these places......
#CROOKEDHILLARY stole from Haiti and CRICKETS.
Since when are we supposed to act like all countries are great???
"Well, they are shithole countries, shoe fits, even if you didnâ€™t say it... JS"
"As a South African i want to know whether President views my country as a "" shithole"" yes or no so i cam make my mind up as to how i feel about him ."
When we all know what the Clintons did with the $$$ allocated for Haiti.
"The question is how is Haiti?How is the people ?How is life in Haiti? The life over there is it how is suppose to be? What is the root cause of life in Haiti,is it corruption or lack of poor performance."
"Mr President only thing you want in Haiti is change,Haiti can be close America and remained same."
Peter Heck you're free to go and help with those shithole countries.
HILLARY AND BILL STOLE BILLIONS FROM HAITI. BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE US IS AT AN ALL TIME LOW. Yet the media insists on gong with this story to try to prove once again that Trump and all who voted for him are racists. This is another distraction folks. It's just another attack. Let it pass. They want us sidetracked with this.
The only reason Haiti is so poor is because the Clintons foundation raped it's wealth .
Expose the corruption in Haiti that ties human trafficking to u.s corrupt officials
So Hillary and Peter are you spending your vacation in Haiti this year.
#PleaseStopMSM from hurting our country even more!
"Haiti is a shithole, I donâ€™t see what the big deal is"
"Haiti is that way because the Haitians want it .....No rules ...."
If Haiti had the money the Clinton's stole from them they would be much better off
Dick Durbin should go live in Haiti!
"The Clinton Foundation knew Haiti was a s... hole nation too. That's why they ripped it off."
President Donald J Trump...Haiti and how ironic and let's consider the source of this leak and what they're not telling all us...so I'm going to elaborate more on Haiti's situation and the source of this leak...so here it goes..Tony Rodham... Hillary's brother...took over the Haitian gold-mines...among other venture-takeovers...too and the Clinton's stole 14-billion-dollars...from Haiti's earthquake-victims and the Clinton's own and hold a stranglehold over Haiti...to where as...Haiti can't make a decision...unless they go through the Clinton's...SO AGAIN...HAITI CAN'T DO ANYTHING...WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE CLINTON'S AND THERE'S THE SOURCE...AGAIN...THE CLINTON'S!
Did you refer to some countries as shitholes? True or false? _Ÿ˜‚
Haiti and some other nations are shitholes . what's wrong with telling the truth ?
what happen to all the Haiti donations we were ask to donate to help ?
I have seen Haiti with my own eyes.  It is a shithole country.
thank you Lord for my country Haiti _Ÿ‡__Ÿ‡__Ÿ‡__Ÿ‡_whatever they said i still love âù_ï¸èâù_ï¸èmy country
You did call it a shithole country.
Iâ€™ve been to Haiti..on missionary.    It was a big muddy shithole.
"Haiti really is a #shithole.  Sometimes the truth is unpleasant.  Japan had an earthquake every bit as bad as Haiti and they aren't living in donated tents and they didn't feel the need to dump their ""temporary"" refugees on other countries for 8 years.  They are not US citizens and yet somehow liberals have twisted an act of kindness into an open-ended obligation."
Let the Dems pack their $hit and move to Haiti..
"Les haÃ¯tien peuple sont un peuple qui n'est pas dans un accord politique avec les Ã‰tats-Unis, ils ne veulent savoir rien qui avoir qui voir avec la politique amÃ©ricaine. De fait, trÃ¨s beaucoup haÃ¯tiens haÃ¯ la politique amÃ©ricain et les Ã‰tats-Unis, et cette n'est pas pourquoi ils sont mauvaises, si non pourquoi ils apprendront une politique raciste contre les Ã‰tats-Unis depuis son enfance."
Being a New Yorker myself we pull no punches...we call it like we see it!Viva La Trump!_Ÿ˜Å
Their countries at times are sinkholes.
FAKE PRESIDENT - No DACA then we should be deporting all immigrants from that SHITH#OLE country Slovenia too. Right DON?
Dang it!  I loved the shithole comment....it's the truth!
People should be more upset with Hilary actually turning Haiti into the shithole that it is now.
Then why did you call it a shithole country Mr Pottymouth
Anyway. And what are you going to say  about other shithole countries  ???
"2 words... Fake news. Sorry President Trump, our country is full of hatred and nonsense media"
Who cares if Haiti was called a shithole. It is a shithole!
Some one will be hurt by bare facts no matter what it is.  Any one here want to move to Haiti
"So ""shithole countries"" is not derogatory??"
Unfortunate reality is that Haiti is an island paradise it's not the geographic location which makes it disgusting
but what did you say about the other countries you referenced?
"You should.  Speak out.  Haiti still allows Restavik which is the selling of children into slavery,  they sell their children,  especially females.  AND NO ONE SAYS A WORD....Rape is tremendous in Haiti and rarely prosecuted. To ALL the Democratic politicians and Republican politicians and MEDIA shame on you for NOT reporting   on the slavery and and rape in Haiti!!Keep talking Trump the TRUTH shall set them FREE.."
You have freedom of speech don't apologize capitalize show facts about these country s
"Google ""Haiti Images"" and decide for yourself if Trump was telling the truth or not."
I agreed with your comment about these countries. If they was so great people would stay there.
Why did poppy Bush steal the Haiti relief money???? Why are poppy Bush and baby Bush so evil????
The CLINTON Foundation made/STOLE Billions from Haiti's Troubles..  Never hear the News talk about that..
Good grief!   How many Americans want to go live in Haiti because it is such a wonderful place to live?  Sometimes the truth is not pretty.
Don't worry. This is why you got voted in Trump. Take care of your country.
What about the clintons getting rich off the Haiti Disaster
TRANSPORT ALL THE PEOPLE FROM HAITI TO CALIFORNIA.
HaitÃ_ necesita ser evangelizado. La miseria y la pobreza esta por doquier. Los gobernantes entregaron esta naciÃ_n a los echiseros. Las misiones deberÃ_an con el evangelio de Crist a romper maldiciÃ_n
"Most of these Double Latte Liberal Daisies have no idea WTF they are talking about , Haiti is a Degenerate Pit of Devil Worship and Voodoo. Why Do you think the Dominican Republic has 2 rows of Barbed Wire and Guards with Machine guns at the Border Checkpoints . HAITI is a Shithole , Thats why."
Where is all that money that the Crooked Clinton Foundation raised for Haiti but that Haiti never got?
Very good question
"The Haitians are wonderful people, but the country is ****hole!"
go visit some of those s---holes nations before you criticize... he's right... that's what you hate about it....
Your reported comments about African nations and Haiti as S*** holes beg the question: 'Are you just passing through?'
Haitians need to stay in Haiti!  Keep the trouble there not here!

I would like an example of your great relationship with Haiti?
He said â€œHaiti has very very good people and Iâ€™m very very stupid â€œ. Thatâ€™s what you said isnâ€™t it Mr. President.
"Keith, stop talking to the mirror and go wash the dishes ;)"
"Louis Botes I pay to get my dishes washed because Iâ€™m very very smart, unlike you."
"Louis Botes I pay to get my dishes washed because Iâ€™m very very smart, unlike you."
HAITI WOULD BE THRIVING TODAY IF CLINTON DIDNT POCKET THE FUNDS THAT WERE MEANT TO BE THEIRS
"Even liberals have to admit that Haiti and most african countries are shitholes, thay cannot deny that, can they?"
"Document everything, you cannot trust Demons, Sir!"
MR.PRESIDENT please don't get too comfortable with the snakes in the room.Their objective is to destroy all good.the clinton's foundation created that hole in haiti.We all want your continued success!This is just a distraction away from job growth and the stock market!tape it or don't meet with democrats.It's obvious republicans are running the country good anyway.HOPE for our future is with you MR.PRESIDENT!i pray for you.
Deployed to Haiti in â€˜10 for the earthquake. Was a shithole. Guess what? Not much has changed. Just saying.
If anyone is to blame about Haitiâ€™s condition itâ€™s Crooked Hillary and Slick Willy.
The Clinton's should not have gotten involved in Haiti ...
"Haiti is indeed a shithole. 3r'd world Paradise HUH, commie Dems?"
was haiti not the country that conducted a genocide or something like that?
"Mr. President you are doing a great job. And these countries are in very poor conditions and it is the fault of those governments as to why they are having there citizens leave and enter our country to make a living. I dont oppose it but we as Americans need to get back to realizing that our own people need jobs and to make a living. So yes the shity situation of each of these countries is piling up in our yard. So Mr. President I know exactly what you were saying. As a,Republican these are the reasons I voted for you . You are a,straight shooter that tells it how it is even when it's not popular to say. You woukd think by now the democrats would see why you were elected . You don't sugar coat anything and i Thank You for that."
"It is pretty obvious how bad those countries are. Clintons took the millions that were supposed to help rebuild Haiti. It IS THE TRUTH, could have been worded a little better. DOES NOT CHANGE MY SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP! We didnâ€™t elect PRESIDENT TRUMP to hold everyoneâ€™s hand. We elected him to fix the economy, fix the border, save our Supreme Court, help our military. A+ on all those jobs!"
We live in a first World Country with first World problems....
Well there are shitholes in the world... and calling haiti one would actually be a complement
"#shithole countries. Which ones did you have in mind, exactly?"
Doesn't look like the Clinton Foundation has helped Haiti much.
If their countries weren't shitholes why they wanna come to the usa so bad ?
No worries Mr President.  The Trump Train is still standing strong. The fake news are still not getting it. âù_ï¸è
Ce qui est surtout surprenant c'est que les mÃ©diats parlent davantage de quelques Ã©carts de langage alors qu'ils devraient informer sur ce qui pousse les populations Ã  fuir leurs propre pays
Why no one talk millions Hillary and Clinton took from Haiti help them in the earthquake
Killary robbed Haiti and gave it to the Clinton foundation where it went into her pocket.
"Donald, That is why you are most of the countryâ€™s choose. Love that man!!"
The Clinton helped with the deviation in Haiti.
"So what country were your referring to with ""shithole"""
Maybe Haiti wouldn't be a s++thole if the Clinton's didn't rob them
"To be fair, the alleged comments he made about Haiti and African countries are true!! Not quite sure what all the furore about it is!!"
"No worries Mr President, everyone knows Haiti is a Toilet !!!"
I think Trump should pay for all the reporters to have a trip to Haiti.
Haiti wouldnâ€™t be as bad if Hillary didnâ€™t pocket all the earthquake relief
"Somehow, I find it very difficult to believe anything you say anymore. _Ÿ˜ê"
"That's the plan. When you don't get your way discredit and ridicule, whether true or not, until everyone is on side. It's textbook organizing procedures."
Why not take Trumpâ€™s approach to everything...Lie & Deny
"Get over it all you lefties...he is your president...he is pulling America out of the poo...just let him do his job...if the dog had kittens,I'm sure you would blame Donald Trump."
"Why aren't you people angry with how the Clintons did the Haitians? You ask anybody there, they will tell you how corrupt the Clinton Family is."
"Robert Mounsey: I did not indicate my party/political affiliation in my comment.

"Sir, you are never going to do anything right in their eyes. Stay focused. You're doing great work."
"President Johnson use too talk about Black`s , the ones he was supposedly helping . President Nixon talked about Jews and us Italians . Can only imagine what President Truman said about the Japanese before and after dropping two nukes on them ."

I can't believe your meetings aren't already being recorded.
"Don't worry, we get it -- we totally dig you!"

Even if you did it was accurate.
"Let see what other Republicans say about that. Democrats always like to hear the words that fit they agenda , not the truth."
If its a shithole calling it so is not a crime so who cares
Tape everything. Trust no one but your inner circle
He may have called them shitholes because that's what they are.
I'm sorry your father never loved you
Make America Great Again by making it safe to live in. Let's end chain migration and DACA !
Doesn't matter to me! Thats why I voted for you. Because you speak the truth in plain terms!
Beaucoup d'entre vous viennent en HaÃ¯ti chaque annÃ©e et y en a ceux qui ne veulent plus jamais repartir d'oÃ_ ils viennent par ce que ce pays dont vous traitez ainsi est un pur diamant .

Fake news is a fun term... garbage news or swamp propaganda is probably more appropriate...
Leave off the profanity entirely please. Don't spoil the good you do. I talents told my children and students that people who use profanity have a very limited vocabulary and are not very intelligent. You are far better than this and far more intelligent.
Please come and visit us Mr President and instill a backbone in our leaders
You just spoke truth and libs canâ€™t handle truth!
I'd record it all POTUS.  Put a end to their attempt to destroy you.
Record you meetings with these that live to spread untruths.

Chris you are the enemy of the usa

Unbelievable you want our President to fail? Why?
No she wants our country to fail!   That is the only outcome if we do it her way.
"Barry is the one who failed, doubling the national debt."

Zionist owned media pushing the marxist communist left agenda. Facebook is zionist owned too and they want to put in new filters to limit freedom of speech. keep speaking freely against all odds.
Keep telling the truth! Washington and the mainstream media isn't used to it yet.

"Detroit, Memphis and Chicago are democratic controlled s***holes."
"Houston too, run by a Shithole and corrupt Mayor."

Why would they? To what ends?
Because they are angrier then heck that he beat out Hillary.
"You need to find your leak, outrageous"
I agree tape those meetings.  Or let them be aired everyday like you did the other day.
LIAR... you sicken me... you never had character... you do not deserve to be president... you have no soul and you disgust me!!!
HAD THE CLINTON FOUNDATION NOT RIPPED HAITI OFF THEIR COUNTRY WOULD HAVE REBUILT BETTER THAN BEFORE AND THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE RETURNED.
What did you say about African nations? Your partial denial isnâ€™t clear.
"MAKE SURE YOU START RECORDING ALL YOUR CURRENT MEETINGS;WHEN YOU HAVE NOT TRUSTWORTHY PEOPLE AROULD YOU;YOU KNOW BETTER THEN NOT Recording everything,but in THAT MANNER NO ONE COULD OR CAN,CHANGE YOUR STATEMENT,OR STATEMENTS."

This President will go down as the one people feared and the one people were jealous of.

"rastructure and its material grandeur. It's history, art, and culture of a nation that are its greatest treasure. On this point, Haiti is one of the wealthiest nations of the world. No country has a history as rich as his, and no nation has a culture as diverse as its culture. Haitian art is considered to be the richest art in the world. How in this case consider Haiti as a poor nation? Secondly, in the history of mankind, no not contributed more than me, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Emperor of Haiti, to the emergence and implementation of human rights through the world. I'm the first revolutionary, the first emperor to offer model to humanity, both the abolition of slavery and the renunciation of colonialism. I have dedicated this break first in the Act of independence of Haiti on January 1, 1804, then in the Imperial Constitution of May 20, 1805. Indeed, Haiti became the first country to develop an anti-slavery and anti-colonial policy in the Americas. In a universalist formulation, article 2 of the Constitution of 1805 stipulates what follows: ""slavery is abolished for ever."" That is, that all men are equal, regardless of their races and therefore, colonization, particularly slavery, cannot be accepted in this world. So I forced by my examples other peoples in servitude to the uprising against their oppressors. The colonial powers, one after the other, were forced to abolish slavery at least legally in the occupied territories.Martyr for freedom, I am the champion of the equality of the human races. I was opposed to all that was intended to establish a hierarchy between the men on the basis of the color of the skin and ideologies that proclaimed the inequality between the races.For example, the United States which declared their independence on July 4, 1776. The American war of independence between the thirteen colonies of North America to the Kingdom of Great Britain. The American colonists who were white people rioted because of exorbitant taxes imposed by the English Crown on the products arrived in the Americans, especially the the ports.The claims of the American colonists were simply tax. They placed very little emphasis on the rights and freedoms of Americans. Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock, cousins Sam and John Adams, Patrick Henry, and Thomas Jefferson were opened in may 1775 the second continental Congress in Pennsylvania in the State House in Philadelphia to make a last attempt at reconciliation with the English. The Americans were all initially largely favourable to reconciliation. The American colonies were in rebellion after a proclamation of King George III, on August 23, 1775, condemning the intransigence of the monarch facing a Congress that he considered completely illegal and illegitimate.While American insurgents, under the command of general George Washington, enjoyed the material support and assistance of the France who joined officially in 1778 alongside the American army, the native army which I headed acquired independence from the courage and determination of my illiterate men, without military training and worse yet some fought with Pikes, axes and machetes in front of an enemy with a modern artillery.   General Washington relied on a large number of personnel to defeat the English. In addition to the regular army, which had 20,000 men, the American general had beside him 23,000 militiamen and volunteers, 35,000 soldiers of the French army engaged in fighting, 8,000 men of the Spanish army and Canadian mercenaries.When I was leading the battle against the French for free Santo Domingo, and create the new Haiti, I had no assistance from a foreign power. No mercenary soldier, recruited outside the territory was committed to my service - with the exception of a small group of soldiers - Polish. The native troops led only all assaults against the French positions. Thirdly, assistance to Haiti to the international  is huge.Seventy years ago, either in 1947, the United Nations has decided to recognize a Jewish State in the land of Israel. On November 25, 1947, the commission vote updated the agenda of the plan: 25 votes are for, 13 are against, 17 abstentions and 2 missing. The plan will be voted on in the General Assembly, but it lacks a voice for the resolution is accepted. The UN goes to a vote four days later, on November 29, 1947. Ambassador Emile Saint - Lot, on behalf of the Republic of Haiti and on the recommendation of the president Dumarsais estimated, gave the missing vote so that the resolution is accepted. This decision enabled Israel to become a nation.Joseph Edouard Gaetjens, born in Port - au Prince, is a Haitian footballer who plays in the Jersey of the United States team at the 1950 World Cup. Gaetjens mark the purpose of surprising victory 1-0 against England, on June 29, 1950, in Belo Horizonte.In 2009, a statue was unveiled in Franklin Square in Savannah in honor of the Haitian soldiers who had participated in the American war of independence. Indeed, on October 9, 1779, a number exceeding 500 soldiers left the port of Cap-French to join the American revolutionary forces who fought the English army in Georgia. The presence of the hunters-volunteers of Santo Domingo had a huge contribution in Savannah making. Henri Christophe was only 14 years old when he took part as a drum in this battle.Mr president, the Haitian people are not required to demonstrate that it is a great nation, this has been proven by thousand shares, by its resilience and courage. He was able to write one of the most beautiful pages of universal history in letters of gold. Its independence was not given by a simple treated as was the case of several other former colonized countries. Haitian independence has been won on the battlefield with bravery and sweat and sacrifices. Haiti is the first country and the only one in the world born of a revolt of slaves. It is also the only independent francophone territory of the Caribbean. Haiti is the only country in the Caribbean with the honor of being an observer and Guest member permanent of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA).Signatory of the Charter of the Organization of the United Nations (UN) before October 24, 1945, Haiti is in the list of the founding members of the world Organization. O people, your country has signed the Charter before the official creation of the United Nations decided on 24 October 1945 by the victors of the second world war at Dumbarton Oaks and Yalta conferences. The country is also a member of the Organization of American States since its creation in 1948 and was one of the first countries to sign the Charter of the United Nations in 1951.Mr president, in the hope that this correspondence forces you to change your thought on Haiti, please receive the expression of my  salutations.Jean-Jacques Dessalines"

"You are so right, Mr. President.  It was Hillary Clinton and the CLINTON FOUNDATION that screwed over the Haitians.  Millions and millions of dollars were contributed to the foundation to help the Haitians after the horrific earthquake. Those poor folks didn't get the help for hospitals, schools, housing, sick hungry children, etc. The Clintons used it to finance Chelsea's wedding and give her a living income.  Most of it was used to support Hillary's run for president.  Karma???? Just read the book, CLINTON CASH.  It will make your toes curl."
The silent majority believes you!
We do!
How about the Clinton Foundation and what the Clintons did to the Haitians?
Don't forget old man Bush was right there with Bill......
yeah they were the starters of the Haitian help - but the Clintons turned the help effort into the worldwide Clinton Foundation Ponzi scheme.

PolitiFact is known for showing bias when selecting material to analyze. Itâ€™s snowing!! âù„ï¸èâù„ï¸èâù„ï¸è You lost. We suffered 8 years of OBarry now itâ€™s your turn.
"Patricia Sohn you asked for a lie, there they are. Has NOTHING to do with the election, or Obama. Trump lies. Thatâ€™s not even debatable.  I can list other sources if youâ€™d like."
"Patricia Sohn In the past 35 days, Trump has averaged an astonishing nine claims a day.The total now stands at 1,628 claims in 298 days, or an average of 5.5 claims a day. That puts the president on track to reach 1,999 claims by the end of his first year in office, though he obviously would easily exceed 2,000 if he maintained the pace of the past month. (Our full interactive graphic can be found here.)As regular readers know, the president has a tendency to repeat himself â€” often. There are now at least 50 claims that he has repeated three or more times.Trumpâ€™s most repeated claim, uttered 60 times, was some variation of the statement that the Affordable Care Act is dying and â€œessentially dead.â€ù The Congressional Budget Office has said that the Obamacare exchanges, despite well-documented issues, are not imploding and are expected to remain stable for the foreseeable future. Indeed, healthy enrollment for the coming year has surprised health-care experts.Trump also repeatedly takes credit for events or business decisions that happened before he took the oath of office â€” or had even been elected. Fifty-five times, he has touted that he secured business investments and job announcements that had been previously announced and could easily be found with a Google search.But with the push in Congress to pass a tax plan, two of Trumpâ€™s favorite talking points about taxes â€” that the tax plan will be the biggest tax cut in U.S. history and that the United States is one of the highest-taxed nations â€” have been moving up the list.Trump repeated the falsehood about having the biggest tax cut 40 times, even though Treasury Department data shows it would only rank eighth. And 50 times Trump has claimed that the United States pays the highest corporate taxes (19 times) or that it is one of the highest-taxed nations (31 times). The latter is false; the former is misleading, as the effective U.S. corporate tax rate (what companies end up paying after deductions and benefits) ends up being lower than the statutory tax rate.We also track the presidentâ€™s flip-flops on our list, as they are so glaring. He spent the 2016 campaign telling supporters that the unemployment rate was really 42 percent and the official statistics were phony; now, on 33 occasions he has hailed the lowest unemployment rate in 17 years. It was already very low when he was elected â€” 4.6 percent, the lowest in a decade â€” so his failure to acknowledge that is misleading.Fifty-seven times, Trump has celebrated a rise in the stock market â€” even though in the campaign he repeatedly said it was a â€œbubbleâ€ù that was ready to crash as soon as the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates. Well, the Fed did raise rates three times since the election â€” and yet it has not plunged as Trump predicted. It has continued a rise in stock prices that began under Barack Obama in 2009.Again, the president has never explained his shift in position on the stock market. But he couldnâ€™t stop talking about it during his trip to Asia.We maintain the database by closely reading or watching Trumpâ€™s myriad public appearances and television and radio interviews. The interviews are especially hard to keep up with, in part because the White House does not routinely post on them on its website. Moreover, Trump tends to seek out right-leaning interviewers who rarely challenge him or question him when he repeats false claims that have already been fact-checked. The interviews thus often contain a torrent of misleading claims, and we despair that supposed journalists are not confronting the president about his rhetoric.So we were amused to see a foreign leader fact-check the president on his Asian trip. On Nov. 13, Trump met with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe when he started to repeat one of his favorite false claims that the United States has â€œdeficits with almost everybody.â€ùâ€œExcept us,â€ù interjected Turnbull.â€œExcept with you,â€ù Trump agreed, adding: â€œYouâ€™re the only one.â€ù He then suggested he should check the figures, but Turnbull assured him, â€œItâ€™s real.â€ùIndeed, the United States has a goods trade surplus of $13 billion and services trade surpluses of $15 billion with Australia, largely because of a Free Trade Agreement, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.We assume Trump was joking when he said Australia was the â€œonly one.â€ù But for the record, the United States also has trade surpluses with the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Belgium, Singapore, Hong Kong, Chile, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, among other countries, according to the International Trade Commission.(About our rating scale)Send us facts to check by filling out this formKeep tabs on Trumpâ€™s promises with our Trump Promise TrackerSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter"
thank you for sharing your opinion...you miss the point. Sad that since you hate trump so much you spend your precious moments trolling his site _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚Buhbye!
"Patricia Sohn Since you have no valid response you denigrate me? Ha!! Typical!!Please note, I didnâ€™t say I hated Trump, all I did was supply information about his propensity to say things that are not true, information you requested."
Can we at least be honest and recognize that Haiti is a shithole country thanks to the Clintons?
The man just tells it like it is and the Malignant Media then twists the _Ÿ’© out of it. lol _Ÿ˜ù
"It's the children I worry about picking up on OUR vulgarity. Children live what they learn. And I guess it's better for a child to grow up cursing like a sailor, than crying like an entitled rotten pos."
Tell em how it is Mr. President ! Keep up the good work real Americans love you!
"Mr. President, you were just being honest."
"Trumpettes, it's not just that Donnie is making our country an international joke. It's also not what the countries to which Donnie referred are like. It's that he was talking about the PEOPLE from those countries. He was saying he doesn't want those PEOPLE to come here. How can anyone not get that?"
The only thing you inspire in this country is hate. Itâ€™s the only thing you preach with any consistency.
People heard you say this so don't lie.
"I don't care if you did say it, it's true"
"For me, hearing 8 years of bull**** from the last President, I'm fine with hearing the President saying ****hole."
I agree with the President.  We should try to get the best people we can from who want to come here.
It is a terrible place- you will do far more for Haitians than the Clintons EVER did!!! _Ÿ™„_Ÿ˜¬
Hmmmmmmm but Fox News confirmed you said it _Ÿ˜‚
"Awwww buttercup, don your wussy hat and grab your crayons, this is real life now, no more fantasyland for you."
lol if you think trump didnâ€™t say it or Fox News didnâ€™t confirm it your in fantasyland _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚
Peter Heck.   some countries are shitholes.    maybe you should come to reality with that!
if you did say that... it would be true tho
Libs need something to cry about.
"You tell the truth, bluntly and  people don't like it. Still it is the truth."
We stand with you. These chaps are just out to get you.
Anybody who voted for Hillary is perfectly fine with lies.
I you look at the countries that are shitholes they are run by Democrat's.
"Donald j trump we trust in you ,we love you,god bless."
"Yes, start recording the meetings. They will lie, cheat do whatever to malign you."
Hilarious. Hillary ruined Haiti. Nobody is talking about that.
SHAME ON THE CLINTON'S THAT HAITI ARE STILL LIVING LIKE THEY ARE...PATHETIC :( :( SHAME ON THE CLINTON FOUNDATION...HILLIARY DID THIS WITHOUT ANY SHAME..
Your doing a great job Mr. President  keep it up
It was the Clinton's who screwed the poor Haitians...

To Hell with what others think and keep doing whatâ€™s best for the USA. Carry on Soldier.
Well said potus! Keep up the good work _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
Dems will do anything to twist to confuse the people .. Have faith in Trump Leave him to do his job as President
Televising all meetings is brilliant!!!
"He won't do it cause it would really show the world what a shithole idiot-in-chief we have.Telling the Norwegian prime minister thanks for purchasing f-52's....there's no fu.king f52's this idiot has no clue. It was 52 f35's...."
Relax
Love it when Trump isn't politically correct
"Regardless of what you might have said, no need to bring them to our country! #MAGA"
the media are very nasty people!! keep up the good work!
Clinton's raised 800 milli9n for Haiti but only gave them 15 million. Let that sink in.
And that 15 mil went to there cronies in Haiti.  It did not go to help the people of Haiti!
"They donâ€™t need proof, just need a reason to take him down!!"
Try!!  They will never get it done!!
Deny deny deny.  This man does not take responsibility for his actions
Please trump don't sign that DACA. Is a trap by dems to import illegal voters for 2020
I support you but PLEASE be more careful of what you say Mr. President!!
Truth is like molten lava to our dear little snowflakes.
So true!
I'm sure they are being recorded plenty Mr. Trump
They hate you as much as the rest of the world liar.
You call it like you see it. Simple as that. Those countries are shitholes. Why do these snowflakes have to have everything sugar coated to protect their feelings?
Keep up the good job you doing.
What happen to all that Money Bill Clinton and GW Bush raised to rebuild that shithole of a country
Donâ€™t care just keep on making America great again
Protect your self. Record everything. The Dems will lie about any and everything.
"Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said â€œtake them out.â€ù Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings.Pleas record all future meetings and I can promise you that your base will see how stupid you really are."
"Oh my, can this man lie. He must have an Olympic medal in lying!!!!,"
"You better pray for forgiveness, I think GOD is black"
What does third world country mean? Shithole!!
"HEY DODOS , ASK HILLARY CLINTON AND THE RESTOF YOU DODOS THAT CALL YOURSELF JOURNALIST . WHAT SHE AND HER CRONIES DID TO HAITI AND THE HATIANS. ??"
THEY ARE SHITHOLES THATS WHY EVERYONE WANTS TO BE HERE!!!!!!! IMPOOSIBLE TO SAY THE TRUTH ANYMORE IN THIS WORLD WITHOUT HURTING SOMEONES FEELINGS GROW UP ALREADY LEFTIES!!!!! GO BACK AND STUDY HISTORY AND LOOK AT WHO CREATED AND BUILT THIS COUNTRY...EDUCATE YOURSELF.
"President Trump,_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸ When these so-called rightous people make such a fuss about your comments, they are actually ""thinking it,"" but you are bold enough to say it. Everybody knew what you meant by it. Try not to listen to these negative people. You are so wonderful._Ÿ’’"
Dont backpedal own your statements. I am Salvadoran and you are 100% correct! It is a shithole.
"WE ARE ON YOUR SIDE, SIR!  YOU ARE DOING AN EXCELLENT JOB!  SO GLAD TO HEAR OF YOUR EXCELLENT HEALTH STATUS REPORT  TODAY. #TRUMP2020"
"HAITI AIN'T REALLY ALL THAT POOR!!MAYBE IN CERTAIN CITIES BUT I'M SURE THERE'S RICH PEOPLE IN CERTAIN PARTS OF HAITI!!WHY DON'T OR WON'T THEY HELP THEIR OWN COUNTRY & THEIR OWN PEOPLE??  :/SMH"
"Why is the billions in Clinton Foundation aid stashed in Qatar? Why is Comey still at large? Corrupt officials are conduit for evil, in Greece, PR, Haiti, Asia, Russia, and the US."
"Exactly Victoria Battaglini!!  :/Smh"
At the very least he did not steal them blind like the Clintons did!
"DEAR MR. TRUMP ...AS LONG AS THERE'S A DEMON-CRAT ALIVE... YOU'LL HAVE TO TOLERATE THIS CRAP. THEY'RE GONNA DIE TRYING & YOU'RE THEIR TARGET... NEVER-ENDING .We, The True Americans ... Love You & All You Do !"
check the Clintons and see how they helped destroy this country of Haiti.   and sooooooo many other from the left.
If their countries are so wonderful why do they wanna come here
"You are doing great for the country, keep it up Mr. President."
Haiti is a shithole....if u don't think so go live there......I dare u.
Your such aPOS Man up to your comments and move your lady will sleep with you
People are worried about what our president call other countries but not what he wants for our country
Instead of sending Billions to Iran. We could have built tent city in Haiti.
Clintons stole both money and children from Haiti.
Wait so you didnâ€™t call Haiti a shithole? Is that term saved for other countries?
Stop talking nonsense about Haiti coz nobody's perfect we have all our flaws.
Yah that is a shithole country. But the people we love.
Be a man for one time in your live...and resigned as president...because  you are trouble
"Sir, always assume that someone in the room will betray you. Be very careful and yes, it is a good idea to get someone you trust to record meetings (ask one of your kids) and never make off-the-cuff remarks because you think you are among friends. I have been betrayed often, so I would know. The media is reporting an unverified story, as usual. Just be very careful around others, even if you think you are in a private setting with people you think you can trust."
_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ so is that good relationship with all Haitians?
Liar... Liar.. Trump tower is on fire. Dude lies more in a day than a 1-900 psychic.
Jose Rodriguez
Can't post a pic here! _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚
But pay no attention to the millions of earthquake aid Hillary and Bill stole from the Haitians!
You guys are shitholes!!! BWAAHHAAAHHAAA!!
_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ I think we're awesome
Please record the meetings
You support Trump?
No. Just find it amusing he would think of recording the meetings and then deny he said those things!
You can't trust dems (like the guy sitting on your left especially) or media or some republicans.
"We got you President Trump, broadcast live from now on!!!"
Liberals will always try and distort the facts! They live for causing drama.
Hillary and Bill loot Haiti - stole tens of millions off poor Haitians - that's OK by the hypocrites in media
ALWAYS be careful around Democrats Pres. Trump.  They are all out to bring you down! _Ÿ˜–
Dems don't need facts to trash President Donald J. Trump. Their hate is on full display every day. What I WANT is Dems to be held accountable for EVERY lie they tell.
Why invite the press into the Oval Office at all?
Schumer probably made it up!
The pettiness exhibited by the left is pathetic.
Those places are shitholes. Been to most. Its nice having a President say it like it is. The DEMS didnt want Haiti mentioned because the Clintons stole all the money supposedly sent there
Durbin is a snake. What he said has been refuted. He lied.
Agree
"HERE'S A THOUGHT, DON'T LET FAKE NEWS IN, GET YOUR OWN NEWS TO BROADCAST ALL YOU WANT TO BE KNOWN, PRESIDENT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO BREAK INTO ALL TV NETWORKS, FOR SPEECHES AND OTHER.

Proud of our president.  Liberals will stop at NOTHING to get rid of him.
Thank God For Our Great President...President Donald J. Trump!
Make them all open. Keeps the corrupt honest
Don't forget you are in the swamp Mr. President.  Don't drop your guard sir.

I agree President Trump. I believe they are setting you up again with lies.
"You've stopped people using gifs, what a shame. I was trying to find a Pinocchio one."
An investigation needs to. E opened up to see what the Clintons Foundation did to the Haitians .
The Washington Post wants to be front runner for that fake news award thatâ€™s coming up I think.
You're really funny.
You think the Washington Post isnâ€™t about as fake as news gets Garrison?
So your not denying you said it was a shithole country??
Donâ€™t they remember the scam from the Clintonâ€™s?
No issue with calling it like it is!! #maga
"Why does anyone care that a grown man said a cuss word and not worry about the actual meeting and what comes from THAT meeting. I don't care that President Trump let's a swear out now and then as long as he is doing his best to clean up Obama's big mess he made of this country. If I worried about every cuss word a leader, coach, teacher or boss spit out everyday, NOTHING WOULD EVER GET DONE. Priority to me is getting the job done. #MAGA"

It is a shithole. But I guess it's easier to attack a person for saying so than it is to hold accountable the criminal Clintons for MAKING it so.

No matter what he says they will twist it around I stand with President Trump
let this be a lesson: don't trust dems. Remember this when negotiating DACA.
"and they send us the worst they have,they get to clean out their jails,thats why lots of them land up in our jail."
Stop lying!Sen Durbin who was in the room confirmed you said those words!
I thought all meetings were recorded.
They are its standard. Whitehouse has its own recording and photography people. Everything is saved for posterity
"Stand firm SIR! The truth is the truth. IF they donâ€™t like to hear the truths as it is, then maybe they should step up, raise the bar, and make their country and culture better. You donâ€™t need money to make a society great. It comes from initiative.AND the claim that everyone is saying that those without much, value it USA more, is not always true. Perfect example of what the illegals invasion from South America, Mexico has done to our country To deplete and drag it down. Not driven, most stay the same."
Are you wearing your hood today?
"Why are you trying to work with these hacks, do what your base wants,"
The Fake Media is the Devil's Mouth Piece!
I am aware of the meeting you had with Haiti people  during the election cycle.  They brought up their concerns directly to you with respect to the Clinton Foundations and other organizations that did not come through with the millions for their country that they got donations for.  Having said that no one except the left would consider what you said to be directed at the citizens of Haiti...and from my perspective Haiti is in fact a S******E cause and affect of corrupt leaders in that country. No need to be distracted by the false stories being put out there by liberal media..they carry no valid weight in any conversation unless you are a liberal
Bring back Billy boy and hitlary and send them to Haiti for a questions and answers session with the citizens not the government !
Better than Hillary stealing earthquake money from them during a time of crisis!
"I don't see anybody in a hurry to go to Haiti. Except the Clintons to exploit them, of course"
QUIT EXPLAINING YOURSELF! Just speak the truth and be done with it.
If they weren't shitholes why would their people want to come here?
"Ask the Haitians how they feel, but the Dems won't like what they have to say about the Clintons."
And so what if you did!!!!
"Radical liberals ignore how Hillary Clinton stole millions of dollars from Haiti disaster relief organizations.  Money was funneled through her fake charity the Clinton Foundation and then she kept millions for herself.  Furthermore, Chelsea Clinton stole $900,000 from the Clinton Foundation shortly after in order to bankroll a lavish wedding and buy a mansion."
Unlike what Hillary did to the people in Haiti _Ÿ‡__Ÿ‡_ google it!!!
Yes record them all!
When you meet with opposition you need it to be publically.
Make Hillary give them their money back
Haiti is poor because of Clintons fault. No one else.
Start televising them all if dems are involved
Tim see he never called that shithole country any derogatory names lol
Not a problem here Mr President.....carry on!
We all heard you say it. What in the hell makes you think you can turn around and lie about it now.
Ryan Optional DingusDingus..of course you didn't  ....typical
All distractions TIME FOR PUBLIC MEETING ON IMMIGRATION TO PUT ALL ON CAMERA UNTIL THE DEAL IS DONE. SHOW AMERICA HOW THE DEAL IS DONE.
I believe YOU. Reversing what they do and say to suit there evil agenda.
The potato famine drove my mum's family to emigrate from Ireland to the US over a century ago. 'Sh!thole' is the mildest term my elder kin still use to describe the utter nightmare my ancestors escaped. Legally.
Ryan Optional Dingus 'Gangs of New York' is a fabulous movie about Irish-immigrant 'white privilege'.
Please record your meetings President Trump because they are never going to stop their fake news lies!!!!

You only said what others are thinking but be careful hateful people are ready to pounce like rats.

Miami would be like 2nd to last of my American vacation destinations due to all of the massive illegal immigration there

Love it!!!!
MAGA!!!!
PRESIDENT TRUMP ....your supporters are still with you. If you did say this..it was said behind close doors with the people in your meeting that was suppose to be there now if someone intentionally brought in electronic equipment that records the meeting than that person was totally wrong in setting you up as to what was being said at this meeting and that person should be found and duly reprimanded in whatever manner you deem fit. FAITHFUL PRAYER WARRIORS will continue to pray for you each passing day and as long as OUR GOD has His hand of protection over you it will be made right.
Thinking of vacationing in Darfur......NOT
"Mr. President:  We stand with you, keep focus and keep doing your best for our great nation. #MAGA_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸"
So you can't point out that these countries are not as good to live in as the united states?!?! Why do they come here then????
"I truly believe that this has far less to do with DACA than it does with Democracts merely desiring to obstruct anything Trump wants to accomplish.  I believe they know Trump will not agree to unreasonable demands, and therefore that's what Dems will push for.  With no agreement, the country is due for a shutdown.  Just what the Dems want.Trump has been so successful thusfar that Dems need negatives to claim against Trump.  Dems have nothing positive to offer, so must fight him with negatives.  Trump's further success will hurt Dems in  2018 elections.  They must continue GENERATING NEGATIVES AGAINST TRUMP so that they have something to campaign on in the next election."
To be fair you said shithole country.
"Stop lying for once, you said it, now own it."
Leaveit to the imaginations of losers who cannot adapt OR think for themselves! _Ÿ˜è
People that are jealous of us...twist words
"Wouldn't have bothered me if you had, Sir.  Keep up the great work you're doing for this country."
I do not care if you said that.
Butt hurt politically correct corrupt news media they should all have to go live there
"We donâ€™t believe a WORD the Dems or the media say.We trust you and believe in you."
If they weren't s***hole countries the people never would have left.
quit trying to explain yourself to these whiny bedwetters....we all knew what you were saying
Donald J. Trump continues to trigger the opposition one snowflake at a time.
"It is a shithole, thanks to the Clintons!"
STAND YOUR GROUND and don`t let these liberal nut jobs get in your way..
"This guy is not a President, heâ€™s an absolute joke.There are certain things that can be thought, but not said or acted upon. Even if he truly feels they are â€œshithole countriesâ€ù, he should have never said that. You would never see another President do what he just did.  Not Clinton, Reagan, Obama, or Bush. Well...enjoy your government shutdown on Jan. 19th. Better settle in for a long one too!"
"LMAO,what do you think of the Clinton's stealing donated money from them? Maybe Haiti wouldn't be such a shithole,huh?"
"What the hell are we talking about the Clintons for? Hillary Clinton hasnâ€™t been relevant since 2016. Enough with the Clintons already. I have had enough of these deflections from Trump supporters. Own it and man up to the comments he made.Like I had said, while Haiti might be poor calling it a â€œshitholeâ€ù is something better left unsaid. As the POTUS, he should know this and should require no explanation."
"Shawn Minnix IF! He said it, it was a private meeting! He is the president and should be able to call it like it is in private meeting with the ppl he  is trying so hard to work with! They are traitors to our president and to this country!"
"Shawn Minnix,I'll explain to you why.She needs to be held accountable for her crimes,she lost but the people who covered for her are still in the FBI and government.We want them all gone.We need to be able to trust them and most normal people don't."
I would not trust any of them.  Always use a recorder.
This guy is nuts..what is wrong with the WH get him out
"It is a s***hole. Always has been, always will be."
"Anything you say can and will be used against you by sensitive Democrats. Many of these countries are truly S-hole countries, Mr. President. We live in a ""politically correct"" society that doesn't like you to speak the truth so plainly. You have to sugar-coat your words so as not to offend. They will also twist your words every chance they get. A recorded transcript of your meetings is a good idea and might keep everyone honest. Bottom line: Democrats WANT immigrants from S-hole countries because they need votes."
"GOD AND I GIVE BLESSINGS TO GO AND TAKE GRID, NORTH, AND CHIN...TAKE BAD OUT AND BHO, YOU EITHER ARREST OR KILL, WE LEAVE IT UP TO YOU. BIG C IN BASE AS WELL. NEED TO TAKE OUT MAIN THREAT  KHAZARIAN. THEY ARE ONES WHO STARTED ALL, YOU TAKE OUT MAIN HUB, THEY ALL GO DOWN. [[STICKER]]"
So everyone is lying except trump?
"Amazing  how the Dems can make upCrap. We don't believe it anyway"
"Why hasn't the Clinton foundation done anything?. Oh, right! It's just a money laundering scheme."
liberals can't handle the truth....
You're right Mr president. Truth doesn't  care about feelings
"He didn't say ""take them out"" folks. Alls well."
FOX FAKE NEWS running with the story like CNN/MSNBC. Stop givng that cesspool a free pass.
"We have your back, Mr President! All the way! You rock!  :)"
"Meanwhile, the economy is doing GREAT!  Thank you Mr President!!"
"Yes, you need to record everything to protect yourself."
They are shitholes! Call it as you see it! Truth hurts and we don't want to support them
President Donald J. Trump  you NEED to get rid of the trash in the White House!!!!!  NEED TO!!!  it is so awful that the White House is UNSECURE!!!!!
"You're a lying 'shithole""."
Find out if those Project Veritas Twitter stings are here on H1B visas.
"Sir, we elected you! Not the little snowflakes. Trump Train Rolls!"
"Haiti is a shithole! Even if you didnâ€™t say it, itâ€™s true!"
He should televise all future meetings.
When obama referred to Libya as shitshow.  Crickets from the lamestream media
MORE FAKE TALK BY THE RADICAL LEFT SOCIALIST ANTI-AMERICAN GLOBALS.
Yup record everything this is your shadow government at work ...
Dems love shitholes.  They turn every state they run into one.
"More lies, of course... Why change to telling the truth?"
"God bless President Trump #MAGA#TRUMPTRAIN2020We love you Donald _Ÿ’—"
You should record every meeting. ONCE AGAIN WaPO lies.
"Why? The White House, tried changing a transcript and got caught.  The Comrade Moron is a liar!!! 2000+ LIES already!"
"Diane Muntz-Oldenburg - You are funny. =D Compared to Hi LIAR y, Donald's an angel.."
Your comment was well documented so you cannot backtrack.
"Record everything you do Mr. President, so none of the naysayers have a leg to stand on!"
trumps just saying what almost all americans agree with
"you SHOULD Record all your meeting so if they lie you can say...."" play tape"" ."
Recording meetings is probably the only way to shut up the leaking lies.
"The White House, tried to change a trascript and got caught LYING>"
Well the truth hurts as they say.  Many countries are sh*t holes.
"NO ONE trusts you, when you average almost 5 lies every day, idiot!"
I'm cancelling my European vacation this summer to go to Afica. Right!
"First time we have a real President that actually tells the truth , build the wall using illegal alien chain gang labor .MAGA"
Dims speak with forked tongues... unfortunately no trust is right. Sad. =/
Hati is filled with vodo and child sacrifice. It is an evil place .
You sir are a liar it has been proven over and over
"You are on tape! You are on camera! You can not wiggle out of the eight Senators witness to your BIGOTRY! You can not spin this! RESIGN! You speaking about The better than you, Great Dr. King is obscene and parroting words you do not believe. You a convicted Civil Rights Violator! Your delivery was hollow! Who wrote it for you? General Kelly?  RESIGN"
Start recording. There are a bunch of sick people in DC.
Woe to a country whose leader speaks like a child! Ecclesiastes 10;16!
"Just calling a duck, a duck. Get over it"
"Donnie, you're an embarrassment.  Just stop talking."
Well you did say shithole countries
And they aren't?
You are what you make of it
Do what you have to Mr president we have your back and some countries are shitholes
The truth?   To dems the truth doesn't matter!
"Personally, I think this whole fiasco is a result of him having the media in for that one meeting.  They are ""getting even"" for putting them on record."
Good idea very well interaction and Diplomacy
Take the opportunity to draw attention to how the Clintons robbed the Haitian people!!!
Mr. President you are doing a great Job!  Build the Wall!
There is a nickname for New Zealanders called â€œlimeysâ€ù.  The nickname for Democrats is â€œslimeysâ€ù!
Republican=liars.
"Roxanne McCormick, only those Republicans who are Democrats pretending to be Republicans!"
Have the Dems explain about the Clinton Trust and the money that DID NOT go to Haiti
"JUST LOVE  LIBERAL POST- THEY DONT LET YOU  POST THE TRUTH,  ASK HORNY BILL AN KILLARY WHERES HAITI  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$   THEY STOLE IT NO WONDER ITS A SHITHOLE - DEMOCROOKS"
"Yes, please do record all your meetings. Lol"
"Iâ€™m very upset about our present leaderâ€™s lack of compassion, lack of class, lack of patience, lack of leadership capability and lack of truthfulness. He is not capable of accepting responsibility for his inappropriate behavior. Anyone who does not paint him in a positive manner....is a liar. When, in fact, he has told hundreds of lies since taking office.I DO NOT TRUST OR RESPECT INDIVIDUALS WHO LIE! His poor  behavior has nothing to do with Hillary Clifton."
"Hillary stole hundreds of millions of dollars from them, why don't yo Dems focus on that"
Do you even know when you are lying or do you even care? Sad.
"as I have already told a friend in politics about a year ago......I would have live feed on EVERYTHING 24/7....complete utter transparency if I were a political figure like the president.  Any and all allegations squashed, and upon assassination should it occur.....the people who saw it happen would be vigilantes in getting straight to the bottom of it, and there would be no way in hell a controversy like JFK could be established fast enough.  Political office is PUBLIC SERVICE, and to hold such title should in fact be accompanied by absolutely no privacy, as it is representative of all citizens and is not a personal private title.  sigh......"
who.. #fakeSources
You need to record all.meeting because they twist everything to what they think they hear
It's a shithole thanks to the Clinton Foundation
OK SO HE USES COURSE LANGUAGE!!!  LIKE NONE OF THOSE HOLIER THAN THOU ART DEMONCRAZIES HAVE NEVER SAID THINGS THAT WERE JUST AS BAD IR WORSE JUST WERNT CAUGHT!!!!  BUT THEY DONT HAVE ANY VIRGIN EARS EITHER!!!!
If course you said it. You may be brain dead but we're not. We know what you said.
Your words are always twisted by the media and the Democrats.
"The media report his tweets and words as he says them.It is trump who is the twisted liar."
Never apologize for saying the truth.
Your supporters understand completely.
I didn't know Lindsay Graham was a Democrat!
We know exactly what you meant Mr.President. Stand with you bottom line. _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
Hey Donald J. Trump are you going to mention #thomasfire or #montecitomudslide any time soon? People are dying here.
"Donâ€™t hold your breath._Ÿ˜’ Off to Mar aâ€™ Lago for another â€œworkingâ€ù golf excursion, on our dime. _Ÿ_¬"
You do not know what the truth is.  Hypocrite.  Only monons like you believe in you.
If so then Shame on the liar that claims you did! They just caused international trouble.
"HilLIARy,  where are the  $$$millions you were supposed to donate to Haiti?!"
They r no good countries along with Cancun mexico
"IT'S  SICKENING  HOW  THEASE  SMALLL  MINDED,  BIG  MOUTHED   COMPLAINERS  GO  ON  AND  ON  ABOUT  OUR  PRES.    THEY  NEED  TO  LEARN  TO  DO  SOMETHING  USEFUL  IN  THIS  WORLD  AND  LEAVE  WELL  ENOUGH  ALONE  WHEN   IT  COMES  TO  THE  PRESIDENT!!"
"Nothing but the usual from the LEFT... Fake News by the Libs who are in denial  Get over it already, snowy flakeys.  #MAGA"
Seems no matter what you say or don't say the liberal Democrats criticize it!!
We all know the Democrats are nothing but corrupt liars.
you better believe the clintonsgot there shae
âù_ï¸è_Ÿ™è_Ÿè»_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸âœùï¸è_Ÿ‘ç_Ÿè»The Dems are at a all new low on this one !!!!!!
Dems want dependent immigrants who'll vote Dem
Immigrants canâ€™t vote you moron.
Randi Lauren I wish you were right but read this Newsweek article on national push to allow noncitizens to vote in U.S. elections. http://www.newsweek.com/immigrants-are-getting-right-vote-cities-across-america-664467
"Margaret Bowen  did you read the article you just posted? It says specifically that non citizens still cannot vote in state or federal elections. Basically, they let them vote on small local issues. Stop being a drama queen."
"Randi Lauren The Newsweek link I posted above states: ""Noncitizens are still barred from voting in federal or statewide elections, but municipalities have discretions to override that on a local level."" See ninth paragraph."
Yes I read the whole article. It says the municipalities can override that on a local level to allow them to vote in school board elections. It does not say a single word about voting in actual state and federal races. Nobody can override a federal law.
Love how Trumpers thank the Invisible Sky Wizard for making him President. Explains a lot.
"Even if you didnt say it, its still true.  Doesnt bother me one bit."
Something else you are expected to clean up after Dems blew it
The Clintons are the one's that stole $$$$$$ from this poor country!
"Dear Mr. President, those who Love and support you like myself, believe you wouldn't say hateful things like the lying media reports! We also know how MSM loves to portray you as an idiot and the joke is actually on them...because all they do is make THEMSELVES look like the idiots!!! So let's just keep letting them make FOOLS of themselves because it's quite entertaining!!! GO TRUMPSTER GO!!! WE LOVE YOU SO! MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND PROTECT YOU FOREVER AND EVER! AMEN."
The fools are you clowns. He said it.
A shithole is a shithole regardless of your feelings.
Stop supporting the media! Turn them off!
I AM WONDERING IF AMERICA WAS AT WAR AND THERE WAS A DRAFT IF THE HATIANS AND ALL THE DACA PEOPLE WOULD SIGN UP FOR IT AND DEFEND AMERICA OR WOULD THE GO RIGHT BACK TO THEIR COUNTRIES TO AVOID THE DRAFT
"Yes, probably need to record, but POOR DEPLORABLES knew exactly what you meant"
Maybe they Should get their Presidentâ€™s to start making their Countries Great .?
It's just the truth.. which the âù„ï¸è can't handle! _Ÿ™„
"so sick of the crybaby democrats,get over it"
And the reason is Clinton Foundation ...
"Even if you did say it  , it's  just truth"
yes!  record it but he would still deny it!
He'd edit !
Even if you did call them a S***hole country... you wouldn't be the first!
You need to choose your words a little better Mr. President.
"The quote is from a person ""briefed on the meeting."" That likely means a Democrat girlfriend who was told by her Republican white house staffer boyfriend at the end of the work day during pillow talk. These bipartisan relationships on the hill often screw over republicans more than democrats any day of the week. I'd suggest you'd find all the leakers if you polygraphed every staffer who was/Is dating a Democrat. Powerbroker couples in dc are as common as head lice in a kindergarten classroom in September. Think of Ohr at doj and his wife at fusion Gps! McCabe at doj and his wife who received Hillary donations as a Senate candidate."
"Hillary, whereâ€™s the money?"
Donald.....get to the Neurologist. You're dementia is coming out big time
"You were 100% right. The language may not have been the best, but it is the truth"
The problem is the media doesn't pound into the ground all the things the left has said and there are plenty of them.
"Andreas Fritz NÃ¥r du ikke har sagt Det, men har lyst til at sige det igen."
Hahah
"Find out who did it, fire them on national t.v., ""Ramsey"" style."
No body believes a word out of any dem.  proven liars
Love my businessman Trump. Trump Train whoo wjooo
"America has your back. Thereâ€™s a special place in hell for liberals. Theyâ€™re piranhas, Constantly scheming, calculating and twisting everything President Trump does. Then they all attacked at the same time. What they donâ€™t realize they just said this firmer inner resolve to defend and protect our president. He does not deserve this horrific treatment. Heâ€™s doing great things for this country and heâ€™s coming through and all his promises. Thatâ€™s what the problem is. Liberals greatest fear is his great success."
I never believe what the media says - they have lied so many times.
How can u deny what you said when there were cameras in the room recording it.
Hillary for Prison...lol. And Comey and half the FBI some CiA folks and some DOJ folks.
You should be recording everything.
"What makes me sad is that people in central and south AmÃ©rica feel so offended. I would be do happy if our next president here in Paraguay would be a patriot like you Mr. Trump. Instead of using you as an example and demand their presidents to improve their countries as you are doing in America they attack you and what is most unbelievable, they feel you and the USA have te obligation to give to them everything they are not able to demand from their own president. I admire your work and my dream, I know it's only a dream, is to have a president like you"
Good freaking idea start recording all meeting so we can see who the fake news is coming from
"Donnie, why do you object to people wanting a better life? And why do you object only to people from certain countries immigrating here? Stop lying and own what you say."
"Good idea Donald, record your meetings!, then everyone will hear your lies."
not all of us stand by this lying dirtbag.
Please record.  Would take most of their â€œnewsâ€ù away!
If you all don't think it's a SH then please feel free to go there and live a lovely life.
Trump don't remember what he says.  All he knows is to run his mouth.  Don't care about no one.
"Turn it into a Hillary, stole there heart and money.. And Make Her PAY>>>>."
"Sadly, recording your meetings is a good idea."
Thatâ€™s right we canâ€™t trust u number 45
You are right you can't trust OUR PRESIDENT to give the country away like the previous administrations!
Cindy Lou Thompson O'Quin blah blah blah
respect???
Sharyn Schleisman _Ÿ__â€çâ™‚ï¸è
Yes start recording !!!!!
"we love you Mr President <3 Dems on the other hand, just mean spirited beings lol"
Well those country's kinda are shitholes .. why are all those folks wanting to leave them?
We got your back as long as you keep your word and DEPORT illegals
He wont because he works for Israel interest first. He wants to clear out the middle east for their nwo agenda with Russia.
These people r like little children who gossip about any & everything. They care nothing about our country or being unified. Infantile liberals_Ÿ˜¡
Support him but he needs some class in his mouth.  The name calling is so not necessary and is disrespectful to the office .
Dems are professional one world order liars.
"â€œI shouldnâ€™t have said that or said and done a lot of the bad stuff I have done in my time as President.I am sorry and will try to do better.â€ù"
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
The place is a shithole.  Speak the truth and shame the devil.
Please apologize for your shithole comment. So offensive and uncalled fo.
We are with the country. We are against Trump.
The Democrats depend on all of the people from these S---hole countries for their votes.
Also he said they are a shithole courty
Trump I understand.  Haiti is a trouble island and they have done alot for us individually as legally but there are do crooked ones.  I just say God will MAKE way for them.  They are strong but USA cannot house them all.  They have a land of leaders.  Unless they want to ally with us like Puerto Rico.  You did your best.  But show love but integrity with hope.  God is in control Sir.  I love you.
Yeah always record them President Trump the enemies are wiles and cunning
DEMORATS WILL NEVER GIVE UP THEIR LOSS
"ALL meetings should be recorded, even if it is with ONE individual. Trust NO ONE."
polarising the nation suits you well ~ POS
"it's all good,keep on keeping on."
Whether he said or not doesnâ€™t change the fact itâ€™s a shithole.
except you said that they all have AIDS
Stay on topic.
Jason Garroutte - What do you expect from someone in the lib capital of the US.
Please Do Record all Meetings with the Democrats!
"If this was a closed door meeting, who the heck told the media?"
Why does it matter? The people deserve to know what these politicians do behind closed doors. And that goes for both parties.
And if someone did....they need to have their security credentials stripped from them immediately!
"Jim Hartzel seriously?  He canâ€™t lie his way out of this.  Lots of people heard what he said.  Since Trump lies ALL the time, Iâ€™m more inclined to believe the poor who heard him say it."
"Seriously, Debbie and Jim, the answer to ""who told???"" is ridiculously easy to find out."
My question / statement was more rhetorical....
"""Good people by any measurement we might useâ€”don't refer to entire countries as ""shitholes.""Of course good people also don't say they could grab women by the genitalia, either.They also don't defend such people.""#Haiti#Africa#ShitholeDonnie#ITMFA"

Such a liar and your mouth is a shithole!
"Yes, please do record all future meetings to prevent episodes like this."

I've been to Haiti - it's a shithole. No excuses required.
"But if you did, it would be true. Truth hurts."
This is obvious to sane people.
Thank you President Trump for all you do and try to do
"Yes, you should videotape future meetings."
The Clinton's extorted millions of dollars from Haiti.
"Hawaii would be Haiti if the US didnâ€™t remain in control, France dropped the ball."
I AGREE MR.PRESIDENT.START RECORDING EVERYTHING YOU SAY TO DEMS.THEY CANNOT BE TRUSTED.AT ALL.
Either version of what happened is fine.
Sad. The lying media will stop at nothing to create division and hate
I support you President Trump you are doing a great job !!

Yes. Record all the meetings now. Make it manditory for future presidents too.
"Yes, record your meetings.  We support you, as DC seems to be the real S**t hole."
"That place is a real shithole. not your words, mine."
"Its happening the same here in Brazil, the fake news publish a Lot of false informations about one man who i Hope he Will be the next president of Brazil"

"Stuart, Compared to Hi LIAR y, Donald's an angel.. =D"
Need to have a recording 24/7 even in the restroom and bed !!  Protect yourself man !
"Well the facts fit the description, not like he lied about the situation."
Make all meetings public show their true actions and obstruction
Have any of Trumps critics been to any of these countries? I doubt if any of them would travel to far from moms comfy basement!
So sick of tattle tales and liars....keep up your great work
"Yes, you should definitely start recording meetings immediately. (please, please do this) _Ÿ™„"
"Lordy, I hope there are tapes"
Gosh the media sure have a lot to answer for...
It is a poor country.  If you haven't been there go.  You will see what Trump is talking about.
If their countries weren't crapholes They wouldn't  be here.
It is a very poor and troubled country.
"Fake news is hurting our country and relationships with foreign countries. We can send aid but the US does not have resources to house the world. The president is trying to protect us from what is happening in countries flooded with immigrants. Without adequate resources refugees are homeless and starving. They are falling victim to human trafficking. This is cruel, not helping refugees or the overwhelmed citizens."
"We hear you , we see you , we read about you , we know your past and you reveal your ignorance to us everyday through your tweets . You're  a flawed and troubled man who is more mean-spirited and more angry than he was just yesterday .  You never wanted to be president , you only wanted to make money and for that purpose you have done anything and everything including putting our Government in ""hock "" to the Russian criminal enterprise headed by V. Putin . Do the nation  and yourself a solid favor in order to avoid further embarrassment : please step down before you are taken down ."
Amen.
Hey numbnuts your complicit wifeâ€”who immigrated here from a shithole country that took til 1991 (Sad!!) to declare peaceful independence from the communist-led Yugoslav Armyâ€”is the second FLOTUS in history to not sleep in the same room as the POTUS. Wonder why_Ÿ_”
"Riiiight!! You meant the GOOD kind of ""shithole."""
President Trump is not afraid to tell the truth!
Standing behind you Sir!!!! Your doing an excellent job!!! You are what America needs!!!
Record everything with these reporters and dems. So dishonest anymore.
"Spyro TheodosisShows how the meeja and dems twist things to suit their agenda..."
AMAZING HOW THE DEMOS TWIST ALL AROUND FOR THEIR ADVANTAGE!! BETTER START LISTENING MORE CAREFUL!! ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S RECORDED!!
Dan Teer really sad. Love our president.
You are the best President Trump we love and support you!!!!
We support and love you Mr. President. Thank you for keeping us safe!
You said it.  Everything should be recorded because it is YOU than canâ€™t be trusted.
Go Trump Go...Making America Great Again !!!
Both Republicans and Democrats are confirming your comments. Way to continue to be the most divisive president in history.
"Can't be true, his base says the Dems did it, if his base says it, it must be true (sarcasm)."
I love reading all the snowflakes comments. Lmao
"NEVER TRUST THE DEMOCRATS MR. PRESIDENT, START HAVING ALL THESE MEETINGS ON TV, MAKE THEM FACE THE PEOPLE THEY REPRESENT."
I stand with my commander and chief..nuff said..haters gonna hate!
No worries in today's society if your truthful or honest people consider it an issue...lol
Get the leaker!  Ban him/her from future meetings!
TRIBULATION LIKE THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE...COME LORD JESUS_Ÿ˜‡
Maybe the news media. Needs to be talking more about the Clinton foundation. Haiti is  still looking for the  money from the foundation.....
If it's not a shithole then why do they want to leave...
You ain't got to apologize to me I like an honest president
You know your doing the right thing when people must lie to make you look bad! MAGA
"Probably should - then there is no ""scandals"" for them to create!"
Donald ! Just keep doing the much need job ! Like spoiled kids after daddy comes home
Heâ€™s going to have to record every time he speaks because all they do is twist every word that comes out of his mouth. Itâ€™s getting old
We trust and love you sir God Bless you and family and keep on keeping on Thank you
"Nobody believes anything the Dumbocrats say. Stand strong! We got your back, Mr. PRESIDENT! !"
God bless you President Trump! Thank you for working so tirelessly on our behalf. #MAGA!!
Yes record them so no way it can be twisted
YES!  Perfect idea! Sad that it is necessary!
Keep pissing off the libtards. Itâ€™s part of the reason I helped elect you. Keep on Trumpin
Ask the Clintons what they did for the Haitians. Specifically Haitian children.
"Yes, record the meetings, and bar Dick Durbin from attending."
We know.Your heart is pure.Even if you did.So what?
He was only saying what people are thinking.  He speaketh the truth.
I stopped listening to the media a long time ago. Just keep making America great again!
"I know Mr. President.  These ""brain-dead"" reporters, need to be sued!"
"â€œLiberals are more concerned with what Trump may have said about Haiti(IF he even said it..), then what Hillary actually DID to Haiti. Go look it up people. She extorted that country like no other!â€ù"
But you maintain what you said about Africa? Ok _Ÿ_”
"Talk to Limbaugh. He learned to record meetings years ago, and recommends it."
It is a s***hole! It might not be so bad if Clinton had not stolen the earthquake recovery $$$.
"Typical Liberal Democrats always blame & LIE to win. They want Haitians, Black, Hispanic, Asian votes no matter what. Itâ€™s a SCAM. America is already $20 Trillion in debt."
Democrats are toast and will do anything.
Still gotta keep draining the swamp
"We are republicans are scared and leaving,we will see"
I'm long past believing anything coming from the media.
God bless you.  My prayers are with you.
DOPE
Might be smart to have your meetings recorded or a secretary taking notes.
"AND A GREAT BIG ""THANK YOU"" TO JAMES SHIPLEY FOR REMEMBERING AND REPEATING THE ""TRUE"" FACT'S."
"You're a disgusting human.#shitholepresident"
Its a SHITHOLE there I said it
May God strike you dead if you're lying.
"It snowed around here last night but it didn't stick.. Hmmm Beautiful day #meltedrightaway"
"We are with you, pushing so hard...."
"Not bothered at all by the "" shithole "" reference, nice to have a president that speaks the truth."
"Absolutely must record all meetings with Dems,of course media will still make up stories"
Ride on Mr.president ! We know the crook media and their antics .your policies are superb!
DOPE
Atta  boy !
THEY ARE CONSTANTLY STIRRING THE POT TO TAKE THE FOCUS OFF OF THE CLINTONS AND THE REST OF THEM STEALING MONEY AND DEALING INFLUENCE FOR PROFIT.  RECORD THE MEETINGS.  THEY CAN'T BE TRUSTED!
You are such trash and your cult members are even trashier.
Unlike the dems. and killory that ripped them off for millions.   Got your back President.
Here's a thought....dont Invite them
"So what even if he said that , who cares.Thats why we elected him because he says what most people think."
"I believe you Donnie.  The dems need ""taken out"" haha#MAGA"
You need to make some changes some people in your circle are scum!
"You are doing a great job...record everything, even what your opponents say"
No one who matters really cares if you do say SHITHOLE Sir....
The WORLD cares you Dumbsh*t...he's a disgrace to our country!
"How much money does America dump into Haiti to ""help"" them?  How much is stolen from The People of Haiti before any good is done?  When watching news on TV it makes me wonder if Home Depot, or any other company for that matter, every ship paint to these $***hole countries?  Cuba looks like it hasn't been painted since The Revolution and the other islands seem to have no construction material other than corrugated sheet metal.  These countries would have more respect if they showed more self respect."
Please record every meeting from here on out. We need to shut the Dems down.
"We'd be more than happy to find he didn't say that.  It won't shut us down because we want a President to not say such things.You keep thinking our agendas are purely political.Is that because yours are?"
It's just my worldview. Have you read the 48 laws of power?
"I've heard about it.  You think it's got liberals figured out, huh? Hey, I'm wondering.  How come half of the comments, like yours, seem to believe the idea that he didn't say this, and half of them are on board with it, like ""hey, he just says it like it is!"""
what if he DID say it?  Would your mind still twist it around into something antagonistic against dems?
"Actually, I have looked into this book before, and even read the laws, while I have not read the book.I hope you understand that I reject the book entirely.  It's profoundly anti christian and anti american."
"Sure, but it's utilized by everyone in power at some level, whether they've read the book or not. All the book did was articulate human nature.As far as whether he said it? I don't care if he did or didn't say it. I call places ""shitholes"" and people ""shitheads"" if they deserve it."
"GOP Sen. Tim Scott says fellow South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham, who attended the bipartisan immigration meeting at the White House, confirmed to him that President Trump referred to African countries as â€œshithole countries.â€ù"
No need to defend them because there's nothing wrong with what he said.
wow
"just wondering how you were going to shut dems down then?  President's denying he said it...Do you THINK, like do you THINK through things?"
"I am not sure those questions had any direction. If the President didn't say it, then Democrat leaders are liars pushing an agenda. If he did say it, I don't see any issue with his comments, because they're true and Haiti is a shithole."
You win both ways...
"I don't win if democrats are liars. There's no way to prove or disprove their allegations, which they have become masters at deploying, so it just becomes a ploy to keep the Public pissed off."
by Trump you mean
"See, I'm pissed that he would say such a thing.  You should too."
Why would you be pissed? It's true.
Speaking of liars...wouldnâ€™t you agree that Trump is one of the biggest ones?
I wouldn't care if Obama called a shithole a shithole.
Liberals are liars. One made up story after another.
Yes you should never trust  Democrates
pretty sure everything IS recorded ...so letâ€™s hear it and clean up this mess!
We know it's the press ! Don't matter what Trump does fake news will find fault .
"If the meeting was bipartisan, where are the republicans saying that he never said that???"
You still have 7 more years to get them in line!!
Recording the meetings is probably a good idea since the Dems are so good at make believe and lies.
Best President ever!!! You have our complete faith.
"liar liar liar pants on fire.      You have lied more than 2,000 times."
"Ya, you did. Too much of a coward to own your own comments? Not surprising."
I agree record. Dems will say anything. Why go to press? Fishy story. Untrue I am sure
"If you would just not talk, just donâ€™t say any words. Please."
Itâ€™s ok Mr Trump they are shitholes.  MSNBC is in full meltdown mode _Ÿ_£_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ_£
I trust my President _Ÿ’¯% when it comes to our Country! _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
"Well, well, well.....hahaha......all of those â€œreportersâ€ù like Wolf Blitzer said it on air....hahaha"
Keep a recording whenever you meet with anyone. Then your words canâ€™t be construed wrong.
"Democrats are uncomfortable with this kind of , unpolitically correct honesty."
"keep saying it how it is , no-one else does"
got to love this president for speaking the truth
"Paul Galvez, PaulHillary is not in Office, it's Trump. Forget hillary and focus on priorities.And no Leader is as ignorant as to express himself with offensive language towards anyone ever."
Yes record all meetings. Need to protect yourself.
Got caught lying again Trump ?  Use your Trump skills and tell a bigger lie to get out of it !  _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚
I can't wait to see what diversion tactic he will use this time.
Why should we believe anything you say? You're a compulsive liar.
Lmao. But Hillary. Now THATS a paragon of truth!!
Lock him up. Now!
We didn't believe it for a minute. Don't even give it a second thought.
"Curto e grosso como um coice de um porco!!! ParabÃ©ns, Trump!!!!I prefer this way!!!!"

"I think it's a awesome idea, then the world will see you for who you really are."
"Most of the world does, except for his base."
Hi 5^ Roxanne
"If they are not shitholes, why come here, why not stay? When was the last time anyone vacationed in any of those countries?"
"Oh, you did, lying man."
"Nice , all people around you are liars right....  _Ÿ§ "
"You love them much better than the Clintons Sir TrumpFake news"
"His language may not always be pretty,  but he tells the truth. Those countries ARE shi*holes."
Record everything so they stop making things up
chill on the down talking mr. Trump because you making it hard for yourself for another term
"The p*ssy grabber, this guy is a d*ck head"
The truth hurts. Shitholes is what they are.

The Haitian government is about self. They donâ€™t empower the people. The people are oppressed. I have visited there twice and experienced the neglect and poverty. Thank you President for speaking your mind.
I believe our President before believing FAKE NEWS.
We know those democrats are so honest. Lol.
They can't handle the truth!
Trust is earned you small handed bafoon

We believe you president Trump continue to make America Great Again. God bless you and your family !
We know what you said...you spoke the truth
Unpresidential does not even begin to describe you.  When does all the winning start?
The minute we elected a new president or get this one out of the White House.

This right here is the definition of batshit crazy.
WHAT HAPPENED  TO THAT  BUNDLE   OF  CASH  THE CLINTONS  WERE  GOING TO REBUILD    HAITI??///     THEY  RIPPED   OFF  SO MANY      AND GOT AWAY  WITH THIS  CRIME .   THEY  HAVE  OBAMA   IN  THE   CLINTON     JUNK  YARD    TO COVER   THIS
Yes you should and I hope you learned a very good lesson.
Haven't seen this many butthurt deplorables since Jefferson Davis lost the civil war.
We do NOT listen to the fake news that is spewed out there by the disrespectful unpatriotic MSM.  Keep forging forward Mr. President and don't let the dark side of people stop you
"This is actually calling a spade, a spade.Good one Trump!!!"
Iam sick of the followers running to the cliff ready to jump
"Record everything! Nowadays, no one asks for proof or evidence... just assumptions."
"I'm sure he did say that. But, so what,it's true!!!!"
"Just keep on keeping on, Mr.President! Youâ€™re doing a fine job!"
Our economy is finally doing really great!! ...and that new tax reform is gonna do wonders! Iâ€™m excited for him. Heâ€™s making America great again! _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
"Keep doing what you're doing, Mr President!"
Wonder how the Clintons relationship is with the Haitians?
Besties!
I believe you and Not the Democrats!!They are pathetic!!
Immigration should be merit based only
"A very poor and troubled country,?! Mind your business"
"""Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said â€œtake them out.â€ù Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings - unfortunately, no trust!"" Donald Trump Statement a few minutes ago. Remember the Washington Post printed it with an Unknown source listed. Do you trust unknown sources? Also the Washington Post has had a long list of retractions lately for ""fake news""."
You shouldn't have to defend yourself.
"Do not apologize for the comments you made, they are correct!  And Anderson Cooper can sit on it."
Youâ€™re right- it is unfortunate that there is no trust- how are you going to work on earning it?
You shouldn't apologize for telling the truth about S...hole countries demonrats trying to divert from WHO IS DOING IT ... STAND TALL like an American President and start locking them all up for sedition and Treason. Time for trials or kiss America goodbye. WHO in the right mind will obey laws which are only enforced against the citizens. IF YOU don't fix this there will be a REAL civil war
Yes please record every minute from now on. Truth to power.
"Then he can't lie and deny what ridiculous and disgusting things come out of his mouth. Doesn't matter, they already drank too much of the koolaid, dar."
Nothing to worry about.  We still stand by you.
KOKO MANMANW because that's where you come from papa kaka....
"'He who is without guilt, cast the first stone."" It reeks of Hypocrisy."

Record everything. Dems canâ€™t be trusted
YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL WHO YOU INVITE TO MEETINGS--PLUS IM NOT SURE YOU STILL DONT HAVE A 'MOLE' ON YOUR STAFF--CHECK IT OUT
Never believe anything that comes out of the mouths of liberals.
"Stand your ground Mr. President. I agree we should welcome people in this country who will provide positive affects rather than people who will be a drain on federal and state programs. We need people who want to assimilate and be productive. We already have sufficient numbers of uneducated, unmotivated, troublemakers and thats not including Democrats. We need to get rid of the rif raf and reward good people. I feel if you are not part of the solution, you are part of the problem. We need to start ridding ourselves of the problems. I fully support you Mr President. I hope together we can MAGA!!_Ÿ‘ç_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸"
"Do it, record all meetings. We want that. Livestream all government proceedings. Archive it all."
Thank you for keep us safe President Trump! Keep it real! We the people have your back!!
He was probably talking about Nambia
Itâ€™s frightening looking at some of the comments on here.
"help help help, my phone  number +2348065073111 tired of living without work"

The man calls 'em as he sees 'em.
Mr President all the commment that you will post going to be bad for a lot of mass of people.  The good thing and the great jobs is bad thing for the others party. #Gotrump you are the Alexander The Great in this time in this New Era.  HASHEM BLESS YOU AND YOUR HOUSE. #emprendedoresdelmundo #mundodeemprendedores
This is called lying with out trying.
"Tell it like it is Mr. President, great job making America great again!"
"Yes, please record all your meetings. That will clear everything up. Probably help Mueller too."
So what if he did its the truth and the truth hurts. Get over it
You shouldâ€™ve been taping these meetings a long time ago sir.
"Your thoughr\t process is derogatory , your soul is derogatory , your heart beats for money and not for the economy or people who are hurting. For yourself . You are evil , You are transparent as glass . you are not fooling anyone . It only a matter of time before the people around get tired of having to craft a false stories to cover up for your lack of compassion. and desire to dismantle the American Blueprint. I would love to come and visit the white house to give you some real advice and some understanding of whats really going on in this country and how you are driving a wedge in it. I'm sure you would come out of that metting feeling a little more humble as long as you can take me tearing you and your belief system apart for a few hours . You need some real talk!!!"
"Why not apply for a job in the WH? Since you are so wise and give such great advice. NOTE: Advise is something more blessed to give than receive. =D"
"We, the deplorables stand by you Mr. President!#MAGA"
"Darn it,, I bet the Haitians cut off all aid to the United States. For this outrage!!"
Hillary stole millions of dollars off them poor people. So now they need something to cover it up.
"even a royal caribbean cruise ship full of liberals stick food through the fence on r.c.'s  ""private island"", to keep the haiti citizens from coming after them. our government let the people stay sick and poor, because they would have no power to rally against us. previous administrations allowed this to happen all over the world. the democrat's only wanted controlled people to come into the country that they know will continue to vote ""democratic""."
THE DELUSIONAL LIBERAL  CONTROLLED  NEWS MEDIA   IS GIVING US MORE FAKE NEWS   = THEY WILL SAY AND DO  ANYTHING  TO SMEAR OUR President Donald J. Trump  LIES AND MORE LIES  WE CANNOT TRUST THE PRESS
NO AMNESTY. END DACA. END CHAIN MIGRATION. END LOTTERY VISA. SHOW THEM TOUGH LOVE! BUILD THE WALL! LOVE OUR COUNTRY'S SAFETY AND SECURITY FIRST!

"Oh, is Slovenia one of those ""shithole countries""?  Not exactly the pride of Europe"
He picks up his wives from shithole countries. Not like he met them traveling Paris. He is simply a rich old American that can get them out of a shithole.
I heard the Clinton foundation was stealing the aid givin to the people there.
It's Friday. The media needed something to talk about all weekend.
How true!!
The truth hurts.  The place really is a corrupt shithole
Bush & Bill clinton Stole money from Haitian refugees funds during the fundraiser sooo...
Speak your mind everyone knows its true glad to hear someone say it
Shithole or not.   Snowflake ears are falling off. Cant believe hes telling you the truth
Truth means nothing to democraps when a lie will serve their purposes better.

Why are we getting all shook up about Pres. Trump saying something we are all thinking.
He's right - make a recording of everything !!!
Stop criticizing this man called Mr Trump is a man send by God to save America and his allies.so support this man. Eziekel 22-23-31.
bringing awareness to crooked Clintons' Haiti scandal? :-)
Didn't think of that wow this guy is what he says he is ...Super Genius
"Liar, there are witnesses you can't intimidate."
Really? Where are they? From everything I've seen cited anonymous and some familiar with the meeting... no witnesses willing to even state their name. Your statement is as pathetic as the reporting of the issue itself.
"No, there are 2 anonymous sources as reported by the Washington Post.  #FakeNews"
"Duck Durbin, Raj Shah. Really? You honestly doubt he said this and believe him? Dropped on your head at birth? Fetal Alcohol Syndrom?"
ALL THE PEOPLE TO YOU ARE SHITHOLES -AND WE VOTE !
Good Morning â˜€ï¸è Sybil R. I am Clarence and would like for us to be friends & learn more about each other.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SAY WHAT NO LEADER HAVE THE GUTS TO SAY YOU ARE TRULY THE GREATEST PRESIDENT EVER WE LOVE YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP
Most consistent liar _Ÿ_¥ ever to walk this earth.
Besides Barrack Obama an Hillary.
I trust more credible news sources than this quack _Ÿ™„
Iâ€™m sure your not the first President to make comments behind close doors nothing like tattling anything you do sure seems to be blowing up..
"I have lived all over the world in various third world countries and I can say from first hand experience that the countries I have personal experience have open sewage trenches that channel through the neighborhoods.  The smell emanating from these open sewers assaults the sensibilities of any/all people who are unfortunate to encounter such an area.  If President Trump said such a statement, it is unfortunate indeed; however, the truth is the truth.  What do people of these third world countries have to contribute to the United States?  I firmly believe in merit based immigration but not in favor of open door, anybody who can sneak in kind of policy.  America first."
Got to give the man credit. He tells it like it is. Even if it's not what you'd like to hear.
"What about Africans? Seriously, don't we deserve an apology?"
Nothing wrong about pointing out the obvious
And you believe him? if he didn't say anything wrong and somebody reported it who isn't fired
Believe this ? I:ve  got a bridge to sell you.
When will the media be held accountable for false and inaccurate reporting?
"Agreed Richard Fox,Although it raises constitutional issues the media propagation of untruths, half truths, and personal political views should be punishable by the strictest penalties.Biasing the general public is not acceptable to me, we have already raised the least educated, stupid generations this country has ever known. What an embarrassment!"
That reporter should be fired and arrested for false reporting and slander.....
If it walks like a duck and quacks  like a duck. .. call it like it is Mr President

PRESIDENT TRUMP IM SO GLAD YOU LET THE PRESS IN YOUR MEETING LAST WEEK SO IT CIULDNT BE LEAKED AS LIES AND TWISTS OF UNTRUTH GOOD JOB KEEP DRAINING THE SWAMP
#MAGA #Trump2020 We have your back Mr President!!
never apologize for telling the truth.
Make a record of all conversations you make so these liberals will not twist the truth!!!
IMO...every single meeting President Trump has should be recorded. This is just getting ridiculous.
WHO DO YOU BELIEVE?  THE LIARS COMING UP WITH THE DOSSIER OR THE VICTIM OF THE DOSSIER.?  DEMOCRATS ARE PATHOLOGICAL LIARS WILLING TO TAKE OUT THEIR OWN COUNTRY.  I DESPISE DEMOCRATS.

"Foreigner nationals that intentionally break our Federal American laws should be considered enemies of the States,  enemies of the State are prisoners of war and should be held in captivity until their country of origin claims them and agrees to our terms for their release If an American goes to China and steals a pair of sunglasses gets 10 years in prison,  if an American went to China and break Chinas federal laws,  they would get the death penalty automatically"
Why would the dems make that up?  You're such a liar
I was going to say he does need to record ALL of his mtgs.
Trust No One who is Not related to You! Not even the Doctor! We NEED You! They want You gone!
Gee cameras do not lie.  But this president does every day
You make me disgusted and ashamed.
plenty of shitholes right here in America thanks to the leftist poisoned agenda.
"When Don the Con strongly denies this many, many times, then I will believe him."
Haitians are a wonderful people with a rich heritage and culture.
You still have my support Mr. President. We see through the lies and know who the snakes are! #MAGA #DISRUPTOR _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
You tell him Bo Wike.
Keeping digging your grave Democrats u may never see control in the president seat again _Ÿ‘ç
"Mr Trump CONTINUE SPEAKING AS YOU DO!!!!!God Bless you!!!!"
"A shithole is a shithole. Even if you cover it with a doily, it's still a shithole."
LIAR IN CHIEF....CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO LIE TO MUELLER UNDER OATH...YOU KNOW YOUR LITTLE GIRL IS NEXT ON HIS LIST RIGHT? CAN'T WAIT....
"I BET ITS CORPORATE MEDIA PUSHING THESE FALSE SLANDEROUS ALLEGATIONS AGAINST U, CUZ THEY DON'T LIKE UR AGENDA OR CALLING THEM FAKE NEWS. TOO MANY HATEFUL PEOPLE R TRYING TO BRING U DOWN! THEY NEED TO LET U BE PRESIDENT UR WAY, THEY CAN VOTE U OUT AT THE NEXT ELECTION UNTIL THEN THEY NEED TO STOP THEIR PROPAGANDA..."
Every time Trump opens his mouth he's telling them lie
Keep up the good work Mr. President. Build the Wall! #MAGA
Do NOT meet with any Democrats unless you record it and have it on tape!
President only told the truth?  They are shitholds!!
Who gives a hoot about that crap! As long as the economic results keep coming .. Iâ€™m in
I thought Bill Clinton fixed this...                                                  http://www.nationalreview.com/article/437883/hillarys-america-secret-history-democratic-party-dinesh-dsouza-clinton-foundation
Dems are going to find something wrong with everything the President does.
Trump cannot stop lying. That's the nature of his presidency.
YOU WILL FOREVER BE KNOWN AS THE SINGLE MOST OFFENSIVE & DIVISIVE CREATURE TO EVER WALK THE EARTH AND FOR THAT U SHOULD BE PROUD 4 URSELF BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER FELT MORE HATED BY ANY AMERIKKKAN PRESIDENT THAN I FEEL UR HATRED FOR ALL NON-WHITE INDIVIDUALS TODAY!!! #DENIALISTHETRUENATUREOFALLGREATLIARS!!!
Democrats are in complete panic and melt down. Thank you President Trump.
"We believe you, but if you had said it is nothing but the truth"
Dems are mad cause their base is getting deported or stopped from  coming in anymore.
"The dems will do anything to keep DACA in place. No deal. Build the Wall."
Once again never believe news owned by a political party.  These cnn followers are lost in the woods.  They are wonderers who wonâ€™t get their own info they are are addicted to fake info.
"Record everything, you can not trust a dem..."
Wonder how many will believe this. Of course he has to come out and say this...
If you televised like the imagination meeting........
"With the Democrats you have to lie and distort everything, they are the party of liars.  These 3rd world countries are h*ll holes.  That does not mean the people arenâ€™t good.  It also does not mean we have to take on the burden of supporting them.  The truth is we have more then enough indigents here already. We want merit based immigration or none at all.   IMMIGRATION:  CONGRESS NEEDS TO WORK FOR AMERICANS NOT FOREIGNERS!Build the Wall, Fund more border security, Stop ALL chain-in migration, Stop anchor babies, Stop VISA lotteriesCut ALL VISA numbers in half Stop amnesty, Stop citizenship for DACA, Make E-Verify mandatory."
How many times do people have to be shown that democrats cannot be trusted?  Ever.
Never never never again must a moron like this enter the WH.
"Yes, even a private meeting isn't private."
looney liberal logic depends totally on made up comments and innuendos.
Venezuela is a shithole and they can't even buy toilet paper.
Thatâ€™s the first thing you should have learned. Dems are looking for ways to hurt you. No trust!
Can't get use to the Blunt Force we now have as a sitting President...make no apologies for truth...âù__Ÿ’™_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸
Oh yes please record them all. May as well be tying your own noose
"Nobody believes Trump.https://www.army.mil/article/198721/army_national_guard_soldier_gives_his_life_to_save_others_in_massive_nyc_apartment_fireThis hero is from Ghana."
"The only ""shithole"" is just below your nose. Shut it."
So every single person in the meeting is lying but You? Lmfao
Oh ok and 'deplorables' was not offensive either......stop the madness
I think that he does have to record future meetings with Hati because the media is so toxic
"Yeah, only Dumpster Bonespur is telling the truth. MAGA...Many Are Getting Arrested."
Wait. So this term â€œsh*tholeâ€ù was never heard coming from his mouth by another human being??
"Quit lying, you know you said it."
"They're WOLVES....READY TO POUNCE & MANIPULATE EVERY WORD. Ponder every reply...give vague replies...& LEAVE THEM GUESSING AT EVERY ACTION YOU TAKE. Shut their light off....let the dog chase its tail....& when your actions, laws & bills come out....they'll gasp...& grab fruitless straws...& while they waste time looking for holes....you'll be focused on the next agenda. STAY MANY STEPS AHEAD OF THEIR GAME...."
"Trump, never ever have a meeting with a rino or democrat without recording it."
"Mr. President: If you called the country itself a bad name, just admit it. You say what you think, and thats not always a bad thing. Just beware that everything you do is being scrutinized to the nth degree, which you already know.  WE THE PEOPLE are still behind you. MAGA-GO TRUMP!!!"
"Unfortunately, unless for security reasons must record all meetings to keep these turds from lying!"
"Who are you kidding, We all know about who you called ""very fine people"" ;)"
"But..the Clintons..but Bush..but Obama. Blah, blah,blah, yada, yada!"
With the crap going on I would definitely record.
Take a look at the states here run by Democrats and you'll see a comparison to other countries that are run down!  Very similar!
They will twist every little word they can. Must be careful.
Time to stop lying about the Clintons too.
"See, the trouble is, everybody already knows you are a patholocical liar."
"...and your support knows this, unfortunately,  Obama bread and era of anti Americans."
"...... it is all about the "" Gotcha "" ....."
Record every interaction with them
You were heard by many. Your just a liar.
Drain the sewer. Throw out ANYONE who leaks or takes the bait.
Stop worrying about it..People know what the country is like..
Televise the meetings.  We would enjoy it and they couldnâ€™t lie
Look at all the liberal you triggered mr.President great job _Ÿ‘__Ÿ‘__Ÿ‘_
Trumps getting 4 more years easily..... #dealwithit
I'm sure there were Republicans in the room. Why didn't they stand and defend our president.
I thought the Clinton Foundation fixed all their problems? LOCK THEM UP!
aaaand whereâ€™s your explanation for the other things you said?
Funny that coz iv not seen any videos floating round with him saying this which there usually are
Just look at who is leaving the charges against the President and it is clear what is going on.
Too late to back pedal.  We know the truth.
Democrats are lowest evil and will lose this one too!
"It's EXACTLY what you said...a Shi#$oleYour choice of words were SPOT ON.."
Establishment media are all proven liars anyway. Nothing they offer has any credibility to it.
I BELIEVE SENATOR DICK DURBIN WHY WOULD YOU LIE IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE WHILE UR CONVERSATIONS ARE BEING RECORDED
Pathetic democrats only have their lies.
No trust is right but you got the arrow pointing in the wrong direction
I never will believe what the media or democrats say about President Trump.
Omg I was thrilled you said that!!
Clintons time is up soon!! I imagine ..any diversion will do!! ..love you!!#TRUMPTRUTH
wasn't it the Clinton's who robbed them out of millions ???
"POTUS Stay on track BossWe hear you and support you"
"ITS THE SAME OLD SWAMP FOLKS....#DrainTheSwamp""public servants"" who are really self seeking liars MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO BECOMEmini kings with money and health insurance for life!!!Proverbs 25:5 New Living TranslationRemove the wicked from the king's court, and his reign will be made secure by justice.English Standard Versiontake away the wicked from the presence of the king, and his throne will be established in righteousness.King James BibleTake away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness."
I wish you would say something everyday until liberal's heads explode and confetti goes everywhere.
Trump the best President.
"I love you, just the way you are ! Go on , Big D !!!"
Democrats continue their atrocity
"GOD is preparing a table to be set before President Trump in the presence of his enemies...for it is written, ''I Will bless those who bless Israel and I Will curse those who curse Israel'', Donald Trump is the very FIRST U.S. president to have the intestinal fortitude to proclaim the written Word of GOD, to the nations, that Jerusalem IS the capital of Israel...GOD IS GOD OF HIS WORD, HE will never retract what HE declares."
Leftsts pointed out that 16% of people who come from these countries hold a Masters degree.   So most of the educated people leave. How does taking them in help that country get better ?  If they keep losing their best to the US they were never be better places.
Should have known the dems would be looking for an excuse to back out of their agreements.
"BUSTED in yet another lie.Senator Durbin just came out and confirmed you are lying!LMAO. Douchebag"
We ALL know how the dems lie
Someone come to his defense if he didnâ€™t say ugly stuff..
THE DEMS ALWAYS TWIST EVERYTHING OUR PRESIDENT SAYS
Itâ€™s the hating Dems there awful!!!
RECORD from now on so these losers can't lie their fake news.
Durbin is a known liar. Never believe a word he says.
Donald if your question was misunderstood tell us why you think we should let them in.
We are with you!!!MAGA!
Please record everything. It worked out quite well for Nixon.
We know you never said anything like that. Liberals are not happy unless they are making up lies but good people know they are lying.
Who actually leaked this private statement from a private meeting to the press???!!!!
Someone who married 2 of 3 wives from shithole countries who ran here as fast as they could....should remain quiet.
"PRAYERS PRESIDENT TRUMP RESPECTFULLY, BLESSINGS YOU&YOUR FAMILY.AMEN"
More peopleshould appreciate our president !
Somebody call the fire department.  Your pants are on fire.
Democrats crying after the cameras left :) Yes find someone trustworthy to record everything
I agree with him.  They are certainly quick to pile on.
Oh here we go with the lies..we know you..so we didn't expect you to say better..
Why can't the media ever report the truth...
"I'm thinking federal laws are upheld against providing classified information to uncleared individuals.  Leaks are leaks and the agreement I signed said, ""no exposure to uncleared persons.""  So - jail time."
Arrest. Get their attention the easy way.
What would they do if they couldnâ€™t run and tattle tale?  They wouldnâ€™t have a job.
CLINTONs ROBBED THE HAITIANs...EBEN DEMONstrated clintons in NYC
"If he says it, I believe him."
What happened to the $100+ million in aid the Clinton Foundation stole from the relief aid donations?
I love the fact that he tells the truth. Makes the media look like the liars they are.
I have only heard one person allegge that he made the comment ...and he was a democrap !!!
Liberals are so desperate they are making things up now.  Typicalâ€™
Supreme leader it doesn't matter...we believe you!
"Prsident Trump, DO NOT give the fake media any information."
He doesnâ€™t have to. Thereâ€™s people all through his White House that do that for him.
They will exaggerate and outright lie to warp people's opinions...our media is an arm of evil.
Again fake news..We are behind you President Trump same as ever..Stay strong
CYA Mr. President! Start using a Laptop and audio tape everything throughout your day!
Dems don't care about reality.
The only shithole I see is the one on the face of the teevee game show host.
So true - can't trust the Democrats of the MSM
More lies by Trump. He even denies the tapes.
GLOBALIST ELITE MEDIA WITCH HUNT
The media has a knack for slime .
They're still waiting on their houses from the Clinton foundation
"Yes, we would love tapes of all of your conversations."
"Yes, record all meetings"
I just had a person go to my business on internet to say bad things for I feel for the Haitians and. I was saying these wonderful people have lived awfully for many many years way before the trump presidency and was attacked at my work for my opinion we all are allowed our opinions if we agree or disagree with folks but you donâ€™t go to their livelihood that very low and mean
And get rid of the leaks once and for all
"God continue to guide, protect , prosper President Trump."
At least tell me you called it a shithole. Don't disappoint me.....
Another lie for no logical reason except you are a compulsive pathological narcisstic old man.
Stop lying Donald. No one believes your lies anyway. The gigs up
"Liberals and their Lame Stream Media can't help themselves.   Lie, lie, lie.   They are useless.    MAGA!  (y)"
#TheLiesWillNeverStop  There were people in the room with you when you said it
THEY ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS! DEMONRATS ARE BAD NEWS!
Democrats lying??? Say it isnâ€™t so!!! They always lie!
Durbin and the others that met with him are mad because Trump doesn't want to back their proposal!
They will always turn your words around
"I resolve to no longer respond to the haters, they will not steal my peace with their hot air!"
I guess the democrats are using the Chicago slums for inspiration on what a place should look like.
Funny how the DACA didn't go their way and all of a sudden leaks start to take place.
Do your pants burst into flames when you type this?
another reason to arrest the Clintons !
Go ahead people. Blow it out of proportion.... Don't care..... I still stand with our President.
"I smell desperation, more s$*t from Illinois"
Seems like a good idea to record all meetings.
Why are your GOP brethren corroborating?
then he's gonna said I never said that about salvadorians_Ÿ˜ª_Ÿ˜ª_Ÿ˜ª_Ÿ˜ª_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚
HELL...I HOPE HE DID SAY IT...ITS THE FRIGGIN TRUTH....OH...YOU ONLY WANA HEAR (YOUR TRUTH)
"DEMS WIN THE PRIZE ABOUT LYING BROTHER--OH HILLARY !!!  AND SOME COUNTRIES ARE DONKEY DUST BOWLS FRIEND,  YOU ARE SO WORLDLY YOU SCHOULD BE AWARE OF THE FACTS...."
Dems keep crying at everything. You dems sound pathetic
We are behind u President Trump.  Just donâ€™t trust anyone with candid comments.
It's ok not to trust anyone Mr President . It's a sign of your intelligence and wisdom . Beware the smiling Assassin . He who sits by his window long enough is sure to see the body of his enemy pass by .
"Like you said you'd show your tax returns if you won? Or like you said you wouldn't be golfing? Yeah, ok._Ÿ™„"
Were any dems actually in the room? This guy lies about everything
Liberal Democratic Lying Snowflakes. They are still trying to cause trouble!!
Do we need to get President Obama to release the oval office microwave/teapot tapes? _Ÿ˜_
We believe nothing they say about you Mr President....carry on. MAGA!
Youâ€™re a proven liar. Why would we believe you? You have 0 credibility.
GOOD IDEA RECORDING ALL FUTURE MEETINGS MR PRESIDENT...

Speaking THE TRUTH in straight man talk baby!!!!!
TV AT ALL MEETINGS.......
"yeah, record it.  you notice there was no flack when you recorded the meeting with nk, etc.."
This is all on you Mr President. You keep trusting these jerkoffs.
Democrat liars are controlled by Satan.
You said it ever Lindsey Graham your buddy threw you under the bus.HOW CAN ANYONE RESPECT SUCH A LIAR
"Say whatever you need to say, we still got your six.  MAGA"
You should record all meetings
"And the way he expressed ""very poor & troubled"" was with the word ""shithole."""
Hillaryâ€™s fault!  Greedy Clintonâ€™s at their finest.
Just another tossed grenade
"President Trump, record all meetings!!!"
"If you open your mouth wider, your foot will fit better.  #5150 #290"
That was sweet.  How is the weather in Russia this morning?
You really think anyone believes you??
The liberal liar left for you.
We know the game the Liberals are playing.
You have to believe someone...I choose to believe my POTUS....
"Sic is what this guy is.., just a insane baby."
We love you President because you are not around the bushes when it is about to talk about the truth. Trump 2020
WORDS MATTER. Lying does not make them go away.

"Yes, in your situation, you must record."
"Projection from the Dems again, they do that alot."
"Mercy, mercy!  the halo was a little crooked.  He's trying to get it straight again.  (sigh)"
"Sir I got you always We the ppl know exactly who you are You got a good & kind heart _Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸ #MAGA just yesterday I donated _Ÿ™è"
The comment is undeniable in its truth.  Crass...but not untrue.
15 hours later When you ain't lying you're denying or backtracking you're a disgrace.
Yes agree record the mtgs.
"Trump said it , witnesses at the meeting confirmed it."
"when you elect a ""Pig"" ... you must expect it to GRUNT once in a while ..."
Donâ€™t worry Mr president your fan base agrees with you. They are shitholes.
The Shithole that gave us AIDS. It is what it is_Ÿ‘ç
You can record them live and release the transcripts. That way you can't lie.
"Donald do what Obo did ,no transparency ,secretive , clandestine meetings all the time !"
"I like the yellow crayons the best..Taste like pineapple!!!"
Back tracking what you said like normal. Liar that you are.
"Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. the comments were ""abhorrent and repulsive,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., remarks were ""very unfortunate."""
if i were the President i would record EVERY conversation i had with EVERYBODY..............  :-P
So he just agreed to let in immigrants from poor countries right
"And, yes, PLEASE do record all meetings. For your OWN good, not that it will help you."
Yes We The People Know What You Meant.
So Paul Ryan you don't get it either!!   Cave to the libr
"Mr. President, if you do record it, do it openly"
Somebody is always getting butt hurt over every little thing
I don't trust cultures that practice voodoo
You'd be a lot cooler if you did. Alright Alright Alright
Just stfu..my god you ppl  ..go back to your crack pipe
Release the transcript if you want to prove you didnâ€™t say anything derogatory.

OMG...such BS you are...Take your decadence out of Our WH!
"Exactly,  wheres the outrage!"
"Sorry rhey dont believe you, we dont believe you, and I dont believe you. You are unbelievable!"
Well there you go.  Record all meetings.  You could sell on pay per view
People quit feeding these trolls..look it's at the top. These are pathetic attention seekers. Do not comment as hard as it may be. They do it so they get to the top post

Ridiculous you have to defend yourself on freakin twitter from stupid accusations that have already been proved false. Liberals really have nothing else to freakin do.

President TRUMP I back you no matter what you say. #sayingwhatweallhavebeenthinking
"Yes liberals crying to the sky about Trump's lies.Name one."
Americans first!  I could care less what someone from some 3rd world mess thinks we owe them.
Go back to sleep under your Confederate flag blanket and eat your cheeseburgers hairpiece!
Just please do your job and be quiet!
"Lying POS, even the Republicans say he said it."
DemonRats throwing smokescreens again to save obamas and the clintons !!!
Every meeting should be recorded.  Period.
"Mr. President, Lynsey Graham is not your friend or worse, the countryâ€™s friend, please stop listening to that RAT, and fulfill the promises that you make to your supporters, not amnesty for those so called dreamers! If you want to save America, you should start from there! #NoAmnestyForDACA"
"I love that this has OKd ""orange sh1tgibbon"" which I always thought was going to far."
"That's ok, just tell it like it is. This behavior got you elected."
"The US and it's interests are not served by the president calling our allies ""shithole countries"". This behavior may have won Trump the electoral college votes he needed, but it also is the end of America's status around the world."
LOOK  THE POINT IS THAT PEOPLE (DEMS) ARE A SNITCH. ON EVERYTHING. CANNOT TRUST THEM TO DO WHATS RIGHT. EVER.
"I love how every time he says something controversial, the stock market goes up 200 points! Yay!"
"Because the Elites don;t want to hear it, see it or help the it"
We did not want a smooth talking politician...We wanted you President Trump...
We support you and still stand behind you!
"I support him more bigly than you. Trust me, nobody is a better supporter than me."
Hahaha
People forget what these countries have done to us in the past.
"I'm winning, being his supporter, hugely"
Haitian government corruption has destroyed this island paradise.  Yes the place is a s-hole because itâ€™s run by a-holes.   We have a president who is a patriot so weâ€™re not going down the s-hole that the democrats created.
"just waiting now for Jimmy Kimmel to cry, Anderson Cooper was already weeping.."
Record everything Mr. President. Dems & Rinos everywhere just looking to bring you down
F...ing CNN turning into a race thing. They should be held liable.
Don't trust any of the swap lizards mr president.

Bravo monsieur le prÃ©sident cela fera plutÃ´t de vous un grand prÃ©sident en revanche je vous suggerais de renouveler la TPS pour 5 ans au moins merci monsieur le prÃ©sident.
Just because you say you have a wonderful relationship with someone doesnâ€™t make it so.
Yes please stop trusting Socialist progressives to tell truth
"Maybe Hillary's brother can help, since he has exclusive mineral rights for the island!"
I donâ€™t see Democrats upset about all the money Hillary stoled from them.
"love how they twist your words, they are still throwing a fit.. don't worry we all see their act."
What the media should be talking about is Hezbollah and Hillary's dossier.
Based on what they think of the Clintons......I doubt they believed it.
don't bother having future meetings with those liars
Trump base expands for standing tough on immigration.  No deal _Ÿ™…_Ÿè¿â€çâ™‚ï¸è until all Trump demands are met
Just speaking it like it is.  Get used to it.
"YES!! Please start recording/sharing all meetings.... We also have ""no trust."""

Yes please record your meetings! The televised meeting this week was comedy gold!
Im glad to see so many with common sense
You should record all meetings and not not not talk to the Special Counsel. He is there to cover up.

Hillary wished trump said it due to hasians wanting their money from clinton foundation!
"Just another liberal trolling for votes, ignore !"
"Liberalism is a mental disorder.  Every time one comments, they put words out that I NEVER said."
How about you make the Clintons pay Haitians from their foundation!
"Yes, and what's wrong with being truthful?"
Mr. President.....I think that would be a very wise decision. It would put an end to that problem.
_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸Keep On Trumpin President Trump! We love ya man!_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸_Ÿ’¯_Ÿ‘ç
"You said, ""shithole.""Resign, you are an embarrassment."

"Boy you said a mouth full George, tbis is bull crap, sad sad!!!"

"Idiot, enjoy your popcorn and don't choke while you are laughing!!!!"
Who are you referring to?
"Good question Gloria WItte, I think I screwed up where my posting was supposed to be ... let me know you see this and then I will delete!!!  I am such a ding-a-ling!!!"
"Love ya, Mr. President.  A CIC who tells it like it is.  No word mincing.  Ya gave me a ""YUGE"" chuckle yesterday."
"That would be a wise thing to do, that way when they lie you have the recording to set the record straight."
"Mr. President, I believe your pants are on fire _Ÿ”¥"
Counter that counter-intelligence!

"Partisan politics is a sure sign of idiocy, the people in this thread are today's proof."
Why trust the media or political opposition that has been lowing like a rug from day one?
The extreme left will take everything out of context.
The dementia in chief can't recall what he said yesterday!
Fortunally there is Facebook to say the verity without the medias !
Facebook is zionist owned like the media. They want to limit freedom of speech as the people are figuring out their real agenda. Keep speaking freely against all odds.
"I'am agree with you, but without social networks how do you ? I know that zuckerberg is tipicly anti patriot etc. unfortunally !"
"PUT everything on record if you want what you say to be what is ""Repeated."""
"Man...they just won't quit !! Please, continue to drain the swamp !!"

Record everything.  Either you have moles or make-UPS.
"Good Morning _ŸŒ_ Debbie, Iâ€™d like for us to be friends & learn more about each other. Clarence"
"There, now, shut up, Dems"
Your private meeting was probably already recorded so just go get it from the NSA!
"There were several senators in the room. They'll be hunted today and they will hide like rats, because they don't want to have to admit what trump actually said.https://mobile.twitter.com/MSNBC/status/951822358649737217"
Now you know why Durbin of Illinois is called DICK.
Looks like the Democrats won't be getting a DACA agreement anytime soon lol.
But it is a shithole full of voodoo & trash!
THANK YOU POTUS for the cost of trying to live raise on SS. MEDICARE GOT 33 $$. I GOT 7 $$
"I believe the comment, if it is true, was about countries and not people. Quit stretching everything to fit your PC correct agenda, LIBS. Lots of things said behind closed doors, in private conversations are not for public scrutiny. Truth is, he's right. We don't need to take in everybody in the world. We have the right as all sovereign nations do, to determine who comes into our nation and for how long. I think poor and troubled nation = s__thole. Not the language I would choose, but everyone is different. I elected him for the agenda and not the personality. If you elect people for their personality, you are a snowflake plain and simple. LET'S GET IMMIGRATION REFORM DONE PANSIES ON THE HILL! Really?? What are you there for!! [[STICKER]]"
President Donald Trump is a Professional and has my respect
